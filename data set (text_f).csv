1,39,少年的你,Best Film,"Every June, almost 10 million Chinese students sit for the National College Entrance Examination, or the ""Gaokao"". For many, this nine-hour exam is considered the most important deciding factor in a student's future: Success on the Gaokao is what determines acceptance to China's universities, which in turn determines one's future career.

Although Better Days was initially censored by the Chinese government, the decision was later changed and the movie began showing in theaters. It's not hard to see why it enticed controversy in the first place as it portrays the Gaokao as a high pressure environment that fosters bullying, mental illness, and suicide. It opens a window to a world where students study endless hours in cram schools for their chance at a good future. Accountability in bullying cases is a recurring theme that underlies the movie.

But don't get this wrong, this isn't a story about the Gaokao. This is a story about heartbreak. Heartbreak for students who are bullied by their peers. Heartbreak for single parents who put their hopes and dreams on their children. Heartbreak for those who love unconditionally and are willing to sacrifice everything. Dongyu Zhou (Soul Mate, Under the Hawthorn Tree) and Jackson Yee (TFboys) are deft as two halves of a love story while Director Derek Tsang masterfully captures the sheer range of both leads. The cinematography doesn't go unnoticed either as every shot has tremendous depth for those paying close attention.

Of the many lines that stand out in this movie, one that resonates particularly is ""If you weren't the bully, then you were being bullied."" To me, this is what makes the film so powerful: its ability to pull at your heart over and over again. Go out and see this film. When you leave the theater, reflect on what you saw. Wonder how despite how far we have come, we still have so much left to go.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9586294/reviews?ref_=tt_urv

3,39,中國機長,Best Visual Effects,"Trust veteran Hong Kong director Andrew Lau to turn what has been termed a 'miracle emergency landing' in real life into a nail-biting disaster movie that pays tribute to its ordinary heroes - especially as the title mentions, the pilot who steeled his nerves and trusted his instincts to save the lives of 119 passengers and eight other crew members. That individual is Captain Liu Chuanjian, a former Air Force pilot turned Sichuan Airlines staff, whose flight from Chongqing to Lhasa on the morning on 14 May 2008 was met with a shattered windscreen about 150km from Chengdu and had to pilot the plane through the mountainous Tibetan region to reach the nearest airport.

As played by Zhang Hanyu, the onscreen Liu is a stoic, almost stern, no-nonsense figure who demands the highest standards from his fellow crew, in particular his young co-pilot Liang Peng (Oho Ou). Although Liu gives the movie its title, apart from the scenes bookending the film showing him leaving and returning to his wife and young daughter, the film is only about him insofar as it relates to the events of Sichuan Airlines Flight 8633 (3U8633) that fateful day, so don't expect this to be a character study like Clint Eastwood's 'Sully'; indeed, what it does want us to learn about Liu, and what it portrays magnificently, is his composure, adroitness and perseverance under tremendous conditions, given the sudden loss of pressure and temperature in the cockpit upon the loss of the plane's windshield.

Together with his writer Yu Yonggan (who also wrote this summer's 'The Bravest'), Lau zooms in on three key periods during the harrowing journey: when the windshield first blew out and the plane dropped 8000ft from its cruising altitude; when Liu had to fly through a thunderstorm over the Tibetan mountains in order to get to Chengdu's Shuangliu Airport; and when Liu had to land the overweight plane on the runway as well as bring it to a halt without either thrust reversers working. Even though you're fully aware that the crew will pull through, each of these periods is an edge-of-your-seat sequence in itself, with Lau skilfully toggling between the cockpit and the cabin to illustrate the reactions of the pilots versus the passengers and stewardesses.

Whereas Liu anchors the cockpit, it is inflight service manager Bi Nan (Quan Yuan) who takes the lead in the cabin - not only is she an exemplar in guiding her younger colleagues to serve with commitment and professionalism, such as in dealing with self-entitled business-class passengers, she is Liu's complement in managing the anxiety among the passengers so as to avoid pandemonium from breaking out in the cabin (therefore allowing Liu to focus on bringing the plane under control). Like Liu, the film mostly shows her in relation to the crisis, so even though there is some hint that she is going through a rough patch in her marriage, we are never really told what exactly it is, and therefore fully grasp how her perspective on that changes after the incident.

Interestingly, while convention would have dictated that the film pick a couple of passengers to show how the brush with death changes their attitude towards life and/or their loved ones, Lau decides to make his movie an engaging procedural about airport and airline operations, as well as air traffic management. With some deft editing by Azrael Chung, Lau assembles a couple of intriguing montages that show how the crew of 3U8633 get ready for takeoff, how control is handed over from the airport control tower to the air traffic control centre at various altitudes, the interfacing between civilian and military in air traffic management (ATM), and the coordination among various parts of airport operations in preparation for the flight's emergency landing. The involvement of the Civil Aviation Authority of China (CAAC) ensures the authenticity of these scenes, with the CAAC head honcho Feng Zhenglin credited as chief consultant no less, but it is to Lau's credit that the nuts and bolts of airport and ATM operations in response to the disaster is as fascinating to watch as what went on inside the plane itself.

That said, even as there is less emphasis than expected on the passengers, Lau doesn't lose the poignancy within these harrowing moments. From a husband confessing to his wife that he is going to be a chef at a work site than at a high-class hotel in Lhasa, to the wife of the plane's third pilot waiting feverishly on the ground, and to Liu's own wife trying hard not to lose her cool in front of their young daughter, Lau captures the gamut of emotions from those in the air to those on the ground as the events unfold, and wisely chooses not to dwell on them excessively in order to avoid turning his movie into melodrama.

Whether as a proactive or necessary addition to appease the infamous Chinese censors, 'The Captain' ends on a slightly awkward note as Liu and the rest of the crew of 3U8633 sing a patriotic song celebrating the motherland. That aside, this portrait of the heroic actions of one ordinary person, as well as the professionalism of those involved in one way or another, is gripping, rousing and even informative, showing a director at the very top of his game. We dare say it is one of our favourite Mainland Chinese films this year, and we dare guarantee you'll be similarly enraptured by this effortless crowdpleaser. As paradoxical as it sounds, this is one flight you won't want to miss.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10218664/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1
4,38,三夫Three Husbands,Best Film,"Seven wins and 11 nominations? That headline might have been rewritten as ""most creative ways to have sex"". I think I've seen most if not all of Fruit Chan's other films, and while he is undoubtedly a famous, talented, and creative director, this effort was really over the top. I'm not so certain Mui was really enjoying her work, but am certain I will never look at a prosthetic arm, an eel, or a papaya in the same way ever again. Somehow this lurched from one event to the next, but I will say it captured Aberdeen and Tai O's raunchy flavours neatly. The subtitles were absolutely brilliant and captured the vernacular perfectly.",
5,38,西遊記女兒國Cho Hwa Sung,Best Art Direction,"
Supernatural beings repeatedly attack the heroes of “The Monkey King 3,” but love, not war, is the principal threat in this CGI-heavy Chinese adventure. Pious monk Xuanzang (William Feng) is traveling to the fabled West to retrieve essential Buddhist scriptures when he encounters an elk­riding queen (Zanilia Zhao) who’s never seen a man before. She falls for him, and Xuanzang is tempted as well, although his calling is to love all creation, not just a single, doe-eyed beauty.
Xuanzang is the central character, as he is in the movie’s source, “Journey to the West,” a much-adapted 16th-century novel. But when there’s fighting to be done, director Soi Cheang shifts his focus to the monk’s playful companion, man-monkey Wukong (Aaron Kwok). Also on the quest are blue-skinned Wujing (Him Law) and pig-faced Bajie (Xiaoshenyang). All four are male, which is a problem after they follow the queen to her home, the Womanland, where, as we are told, “being a man is a capital offense.” Escaping execution at the hands of the queen’s dogmatic enforcer (Gigi Leung) becomes foremost on the pilgrims’ agenda.
Wukong and his pals tangle with giant scorpions and a lovelorn river god (Lin Chi-ling) who can take the form of a dragon-whale. But much of “The Monkey King 3” is devoted to philosophical musing and romantic mooning, the latter cued to a drippy ballad. Viewers who aren’t in the mood for star-crossed love will prefer the slapstick and earthy humor, including a sequence in which three of the guys get pregnant. It’s another fine mess the resourceful monkey king has to rescue his comrades from.
Unrated. At the AMC Loews Rio Cinemas 18. Contains cartoonish violence and a subplot about abortion. In Mandarin with subtitles. 116 minutes.

6,38,西遊記女兒國,Best Visual Effects,"The 16th-century Chinese novel “Journey to the West” has been mined for countless movies and TV shows, including the international blockbuster hits “The Monkey King” and “The Monkey King 2.” Like its predecessors, the third “Monkey King” adapts a small segment of the 100-chapter epic — and does so well enough to suggest that this series should keep on rolling.

Once again, talented director Soi Cheang applies his knack for purely visual storytelling to an effects-heavy production. “The Monkey King 3” brings back Aaron Kwok as the mischievous magical primate, who along with a motley crew of colorful creatures is still accompanying Buddhist monk Xuanzang (William Feng) on a mission to retrieve sacred scriptures.

This time, the team gets waylaid in a hidden matriarchal community where the Queen (Zanilia Zhao) holds them captive in hopes that Xuanzang will marry her and fulfill a prophecy.

As with the earlier “Monkey King” films, the third is exhausting whenever it leans on kid-friendly animal antics and earthy humor. A stretch of the story where the male heroes become pregnant from drinking enchanted water is interminable.",https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-mini-monkey-king-3-review-20180215-story.html
7,37,拆彈專家 Shock Wave,Best Film,"Andy Lau plays the head of the bomb dismantling division of the police who goes undercover to infiltrate a group of robbers who use bombs. This gang's careless actions when life is concern made this cop take drastic measures to bring them down. Because of this, the bad guy seeks revenge from this cop by taking his hostage negotiation to get his brother back very personal.

And the bad guy for this movie was really bad ass. Just that right touch of evil that only makes the good guy that is Andy Lau look better.

A very instance thriller that's very action packed, but there was also a sub story about Andy Lau's character finding love with a school teacher. It's rare that I've seen people kissing in Chinese Cinema. Maybe I'm watching the wrong movies, but I've seen Chinese action movies in which the lead star has girlfriends or wives, but they never touch each other, and even though I grew up in America were our action heroes go beyond touching the leading ladies, it was odd to watch Lau give so very long and romantic kisses to his leading lady.

But as interesting as that was, first and foremost,this was a great action movie from beginning to end. Worth seeing.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5847286/reviews?ref_=tt_urv
8,37,西遊伏妖篇,Best Art Direction,"There will never be an end of adaptations of Journey to the West, the most famous of Chinese adventure stories. This new one marks the first significant collaboration between two legends of Hong Kong cinema, both now working on the Chinese mainland: Stephen Chow, a master of burlesque, and Tsui Hark, whose special gift is for action and fantasy.

9,37,西遊伏妖篇,Best Visual Effects,"Although they’re often designed to remind audiences of what they liked about a previous movie, sequels often have to settle for a less glamorous version of that job description: reminding audiences that what they liked about a previous movie can be difficult to reproduce, even if the movie in question wasn’t a stone-cold classic. Stephen Chow’s Journey To The West: Conquering The Demons is not one of his very best films; it sometimes gets bogged down in its mythology, and its comic snap isn’t as crisp or consistent as The Mermaid, let alone something like Kung Fu Hustle. But its new sequel, Journey To The West: The Demons Strike Back, is an object lesson in the relative specialness of even a second-tier Chow effort.

Chow has returned to write and produce this sequel, handing the directing reins over to veteran filmmaker Tsui Hark. Hark approximates the basic tone of the first movie, mixing cartoonish slapstick, whimsical special effects, and spiritual questing, but Chow’s anarchic comedy doesn’t always translate from his screenplay to another director’s camera. If anything, Demons Strike Back is an even zanier and more kid-friendly affair than the Chow original. Yet without Chow’s unique strain of silliness, it also feels louder and more antic while covering less ground.

In the previous film, loosely based on classic Chinese literature, Tang was set on a path toward Buddhist enlightenment after floundering as a demon hunter, rising to the occasion, and losing the love of his life. The sequel picks up with Tang (Kris Wu, taking over the role from Wen Zhang) accompanied by three animal-human shapeshifting gods, the Monkey King (Kenny Lin), Pigsy (Yang Yiwei), and fishlike Sandy (Mengke Bateer), now his disciples, which is to say his reluctant sidekicks. (The Monkey King has been just barely tamed since the last movie, but still sometimes yearns to turn against his master.) Tang is on a pilgrimage but still fights demons along the way, during house calls that are somewhere between exorcisms (the animal demons possess human bodies) and ghostbusting (their possessions tend to be colorful and not straight horrific).",https://film.avclub.com/a-journey-to-the-west-sequel-suffers-without-stephen-ch-1798190266
10,36,七月與安生,Best Film,"One of the ways I know a film is good enough for me to find the best words to adorn it is the feel of it the morning after. A good film should be a full emotional experience that you would find it difficult to let go off. It should create a warm hold on our feelings because through the course of the film we have unknowingly become a member of a family. Last night, we lived a lifetime with Qiyue and Ansheng.

The story couldn't be more cloying and overly familiar. Stories like this come a dime in a dozen, but this one is buoyed by the sured hands of debut director Derek Tsang (the son of screen veteran Eric Tsang), an inspired adapted screenplay, crisp editing, superb cinematography, a great soundtrack, and an outstanding sense of place and time. However, all these are naught if it doesn't get the casting right and right it so marvellously did. In the course of Qiyue and Ansheng's story, it is difficult to see any other actresses play their roles. Zhou Dongyu and Ma Sichun are born to play the roles and all the other parts they had played prior to this are just rehearsals for this. These are career defining roles and from this moment onwards, whether who will win the Golden Horse Award doesn't matter, because their stars are going supernova. This film lives or dies at the hands of these two actresses and both of them made it soar higher than it would want to admit.

IMHO the key to the film's structure is not about their relationship but how it lulls us into feeling it is about a relationship between us and both the girls. Who wouldn't want to have a soul mate like how it is depicted, not wishy washy with quick superficial emotions, but heart-wrenchingly hurtful and yet forgivingly embracing.. Their character arcs are superbly rendered with an awesome twist that felt totally earned. For me, the experience plays more like a spiritual experience than like a movie, maybe because I love deep friendships like this that I know can't happen.

Feted with seven Golden Horse nominations, including nominations for both actresses, director, screenplay, make-up, song and editing, my money is on Zhou Dongyu for a heartfelt performance. Her dismissive laugh hides a soul in turmoil so beautifully.

My affection for good films usually grows with familiarity, as it does with music and literature. That's why I can watch a good film again and again and relive the same experience without any dilution in intensity. I have a feeling that Soul Mate has found itself in this category.

Edit: Both actresses were rewarded with the Best Actress award. This is such wonderful news. It will be so cruel if only one got it for what are both towering performances.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6054290/reviews?ref_=tt_urv
11,36,七月與安生,Best Art Direction,"Chinese cinema have Zhang Yimou absolute gems like To Live (1994), Riding Alone for Thiusand of Miles (2005) and The Flower's of War (2011) in the most prominent Chinese director impressive filmography. Add Raise the Red Lantern (1991), Shanghai Triad (1995), The Roaf Home (1999), House of Flying Daggers (2004) and Coming Home (2014) as excellent films.

Many other known or less known directors were able to surprise me with one clear masterpiece like: 2046 (2004), Aftershock (2010), Ocean Heaven (2010), July Rhapsody (2002), Together (2002) and White Snake (2019)

Ye Lou's Summer Palace (2006) is noteworthy but his Suzhou River (2000) with Xun Zhou's magnetic performance remained to me Chinese's most audacious, disturbing and beautiful Chinese film until I just finished watching Soulmate (2016)!

Soulmate's story is seemingly simple but with amazing dialogue and enough captivating twists. A lot of attention to details and clues make a tight story from the 5 Strong writing collaboration. Then Derek Tsang and the two lead actresses, Dongyu Zhou & Sichun Ma, really take it out the park with amazing performances and poignant scene after scene, especially after the 30 mins mark. Kudos also to the 4 strong editing team. These collaborations coalesced into a very well-rounded effective narrative. Two competent cinematographers to capture it all and voila.

This ifilm is visceral and emotional with life teachings, love, friendship, family and philosophy all finding their ways to add the the mosaic of living. The characters are trying to find their places in the world like everyone.

Very good study of long-time friendship, joys, hardships, distance, dreams, reality, fears and fantasies. This illustrates life's futility, loneliness and beauty while showing the manipulation and illusions we must create for ourselves and others.

Quite transcending and special in many levels. I cant wait to see Better Days (2019) and see if Dongyu Zhou and Derek Tsang can do it again.

Soulmate secures a rewatchable unforgettable ride as well as amazing scenes of pure delicious writing, acting and directing. Bravo!",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6054290/reviews?ref_=tt_urv
12,36,三少爺的劍,Best Visual Effects,"Sword Master is a typical example for the new wave of wu xia cinema. The costumes are colourful, the landscapes are breathtaking and the fight sequences are quite spectacular on the positive side. On the negative side, the special effects are exaggerated and overused, the story is developed in a confusing way with numerous flashbacks to hide the fact that the scenario is rather ordinary and the movie doesn't have the magic pioneer vibe of the original version called Death Duel in particular and the first wave of wu xia movies in general.

There are three elements that make Sword Master stand out and put it on a slightly above average level if compared to other contemporary wu xia flicks. The first twenty minutes of the movie are quite entertaining and feature interesting character developments, ferocious fights and stunning settings. The movie then quickly becomes exchangeable, predictable and shallow but its first impression is very positive. As a second element, the acting performances are rather positive even though they aren't outstanding or even moving. The different characters are credible and the actors and actresses rarely overact. Aside of one silly character who only has a minor role, the movie also avoids adding silly slapstick elements that wouldn't fit in. Finally, the movie has a great soundtrack that unites traditional folk instruments, classical music and a few modern sounds in a highly diversified and always appropriate way. The soundtrack manages to add more emotions to the different key scenes of this film.

Fans of traditional Chinese action cinema will surely be entertained by this movie even though it can't compete with the best genre flicks of the seventies and eighties. Those who aren't familiar with the wu xia genre should not start with this film though and discover the original films first. I was entertained very well and would watch this movie again in a few years.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5269396/reviews?ref_=tt_urv
13,35,十年Ten Years,Best Film,"This collection of five short films is an amazing selection of dystopic visions that explore the worries of Hong Kong citizens. Driven by the growing intervention of China in the former British colony, many are worried about the destruction of their way of life. Each of the films uses this general theme differently from conspiracies to the Kafkaesque, the shorts tell the story of the less fortunate, the scientists, the food sellers, the taxi drivers, and the localists who are fighting for the autonomy or even independence of China's special administrative region. Each of the episodes move the audience deeply. As the movie paints an increasingly negative picture of Chinese rule over the city, it is not surprising that articles in official Chinese government mouthpieces have chastised the movie. Even in Hong Kong, many movie theaters did not show this film, which is a true shame, considering that the others were often sold out. I am truly hoping for a DVD soon! This is a movie I must own.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5269560/reviews?ref_=tt_urv
14,35,三城記,Best Art Direction,"A man squashed by a collapsed clock tower, a corpse covered by ticking watches: these two images spells out very loudly the dominant theme running through the latest film by Hong Kong filmmaking duo Mabel Cheung and Alex Law. Revolving around a couple's relationship in wartorn China of the 1930s and 1940s, A Tale of Three Cities offers an epic period drama about individuals overwhelmed by the times, their trajectories shaped by rapidly changing circumstances beyond their control.

While the two leading protagonists will eventually survive calamities in China to live happily ever after — hardly a spoiler as the film begins in 1951, with both characters still alive and kicking — A Tale of Three Cities' trajectory seems less certain. Just as its Dickensian title suggests, Cheung's film — the veteran's first feature in nearly 14 years — harks back to a distant age where bombastic, po-faced melodramas were all the rage. Indeed, this is one lavishly mounted epic, complete with Tim Yip's beautiful production design and Law's slow-burning, lyrical screenplay.

Just like the man who perished under that fallen clock, however, Cheung and Law have floundered under the heavy weight of history. While falling short of crafting an engaging decade-hopping narrative, their traditionalist and overtly serious approach is perhaps at odds with the demands of an increasingly youth-dominated and thrill-seeking market in mainland China. A Tale of Three Cities certainly unfolds with its fair share of flaws — distracting subplots, protracted storytelling, forced coincidences and a curious lack of chemistry between the two leads — but it certainly deserves more than the disappointingly low box-office returns it garnered upon its release in China on Aug. 27.

The film might be better received in the filmmakers' home city, where their award-winning 2012 nostalgia-fest Echoes of a Rainbow remains a touchstone for locally-\ flavored Hong Kong cinema. Meanwhile, the art house appeal of stars Lau Ching-wan (Mad Detective, Life Without Principle) and Tang Wei (Lust, Caution; The Golden Era) should secure the film a sustained presence in the festival circuit, starting with its international premiere in Toronto next month.

Behind A Tale of Three Cities lies the incredible real-life story of Jackie Chan's parents. In Cheung's 2003 documentary Traces of a Dragon, Charles Chan — who was born Fang Daolong — talks candidly about his early life as a small-time gangster and then an anti-communist goon during the Chinese Civil War, an unsavory past which eventually forced him to change his name and flee to Hong Kong after the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949. Meanwhile, he said his wife, Lily — known in her youth as Chen Yuerong — was once a chain-smoking, hard-drinking gambler notorious for walking into casinos with a horse whip in her hand.

Perhaps concerned with the reaction of mainland Chinese censors — with whom Cheung had a torturous run-in over the production of her 1997 historical epic The Soong Sisters — and possibly Jackie Chan's reverence toward his late parents, A Tale of Three Cities actually underplays the extraordinary real lives at its core. The fictionalized versions of the pair are less the hard-core outlaws from Chan Sr.'s recollections, but more like ill-fated lovebirds emerging out of a David Lean epic.

Brought to the screen by a cast-against-type (and voice-dubbed) Lau — who has built his career playing tormented men — Daolong is at worst a vain, apolitical brute desperate for money to look after his family, while Yuerong (Tang) is merely a strong-willed and plain-living widow struggling to break out of cycles of rural poverty and misogyny. It's telling how the pair's courtship kicks off as they play music, embrace and kiss amid the threat of an air raid in their village. Here, history is simply grafted on as background noise, or just an unending stream of plot points tearing at the pair's budding relationship as they travel from their provincial village in Anhui to Shanghai and beyond.

Read more Toronto: Imax Execs Tell Hollywood Not to Dictate Market in China

Having written a lot of the real-life Chans' shadowy activities out of the picture, Cheung and Law have instead imposed some of these transgressions onto the couples' fictional buddies. ""Big Sister"" Qiu (Qin Hailu, Red Amnesia) is the childhood friend who lands Yuerong jobs at gambling dens, while Daolong bonds with Hua (Jing Boran, Monster Hunt), a young man whose nerdy, bespectacled veneer conceals a secret double life. Though they do serve a purpose, these two characters' presence and subsequent blooming romance divert audiences from the main attraction of the supposedly all-encompassing epic romance of the two leads.

Therein lies the main problem of A Tale of Three Cities. Throughout their three-decade career, Cheung and Law have proved themselves at their best when revealing universal themes — mostly revolving around geographical or psychological dislocation — with small-scale, intimate relationship dramas. As in The Soong Sisters, the pair flounder here as they try to string together a multistrand storyline weaved through long stretches of space and time. Here, they offer overwrought drama without the subtlety and authentic human empathy that drives their masterful 1980s classics Illegal Immigrant, An Autumn's Tale or Eight Taels of Gold. More affected than affecting, A Tale of Three Cities offers neither the best nor the worst of times; instead, it's a surprisingly middling if mildly entertaining affair conjured out of one extraordinary real story.

15,35,陀地驅魔人,Best Visual Effects,"This show was quite a disappointment for me, as i have high expectations for Nick Cheung's movies. It was not much of a exorcism horror show as many would expect, but more like a mix of horror and romance where the romantic parts became too draggy; This actually have been Nick Cheung's style in his directed films.

In this story line, the main bad guy's(devil) action (kills he made), were not really linked with any reason. There was little gruesomeness or action in the way he performed his kills , which makes the show boring. There was also little explanation for his overpowered status. I do not think anyone would understand the ending of the show

Despite being one of the best actor out there, Nick Cheung, will still have a lot to learn in directing. I will give it a 5 / 10 rating for the beautiful actresses that made up the show 's flaws. A decent movie, but do not expect the best out of this horror flick.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5157030/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1
16,34,那夜凌晨，我坐上了旺角開往大埔的紅 VAN The Midnight After,Best Film,"The dystopian, surrealistic, parodying base of the film has seventeen people on board a Hong Kong minibus going to Tai Po from Mongkok, experiencing a rather intense series of events, after they realize they seem to be the only ones left in the whole city.  Driver Suet, Yau Tsi-chi and Yuki, who are visiting their respective dates, Fat, an aging gangster, Mook Sau-ying, a fortune-telling insurance saleswoman, Shun, a computer technician, Pat and Bobby, a married couple, Blind Fai, a drug addict, Auyeung Wai, a music store salesperson, Lavina, a quiet, buck-toothed woman, Airplane and Glu-Stick, rowdy boys, and university students Tsing, Peter, Dawg, and Hung are the passengers and the protagonists of the film. The ones who go down the bus seem to suffer terrible fates, with the same, however, occurring to a number of the passengers, as they start to realize that something terrible has happened.

Each person has its own way to cope with things, but when Shun discovers that the intense sounds they have been hearing is actually Morse code mirroring lyrics from David Bowie’s “Space Oddity”, and a man in a mask who is soon revealed to be Japanese, appears, the story takes a truly surrealistic turn.


Fruit Chan directs a film that is filled with context through allegories and metaphors, but his biggest accomplishment is that he manages to make “The Midnight After” work in a number of levels (entertaining, contextual etx) without the story making complete sense, in a trait that could be perceived as genuinely Hong Kongese.

Regarding the context however, the film seems to deal with the collapse of the values of society and the concept of being Hong Kongese in cultural terms, amidst all the influences coming from the West. In order to present this rather pessimistic comment about the future of the country, Chan used a number of characters of different ages, professions, financial and social status, all of which, however, seem to go nowhere, at least until the point they decide to unite, in a way. The comment about still being animals is another one, mostly represented through the Lavina-Airplane-Glu-Stick arc, which is the most violent in the film , while its conclusion reminded me much of Park Chan-wook’s “Sympathy for Lady Vengeance” .

The whole concept of the number of extreme and, in essence, funny characters placed in a dystopian film setting also works quite well in the film, in a style that, this time, reminded me of Bulgakov’s “Master and Margarita” particularly in the way that the characters and the events are metaphors, but also function quite good as a separate slapstick story. This aspect benefits the most by the acting, or more properly, casting, since the film includes the crème de la crème of HK cinema: Simon Yam, Kara Hui, Lam Suet, Sam Lee and the gorgeous Janice Man share their time on screen, making an impression even though most of the parts are relatively small. The acting aspect is truly highlighted after the meeting in the restaurant, where the stageplay-like premises allow the cast to truly shine, both individually and in their chemistry.


Lam Wah-chuen’s cinematography is quite polished but very fitting, with him presenting the plethora of settings that appear in the film with an eccentricity that definitely suits its general aesthetics. Tin Sup Fat and To To’s work in editing the film is also very good, with them changing tempo depending on the sequence, with the pace suiting the different ones harmonically, and the same applying to the connection between the quite different scenes.

One could write much about the references of language, pop culture, SARS, and many others in the film, but I would rather close the review here, as the analysis would lead to socioeconomical/political paths, rather than cinematic ones. In that fashion, “The Midnight After” is a very interesting production that manages to work both as a quirky/surreal dystopian film and as a comment regarding the current and future situation of Hong Kong.",https://asianmoviepulse.com/2019/10/film-review-the-midnight-after-2014-by-fruit-chan/

There are too many roles involved, too many complicated plots, too many side details to be cut off, and the result is that the slow pace makes people fall asleep. The camera language tends to be exquisite, trying to show rich feelings, and actually more procrastinating.

It may look bit unrealistic but just for the fun and imagination that Kung Fu is a whole lot on a different level of fighting style you will definitely love it.

If there's one thing I am missing on this movie is more challenging and long rival fights than easy to the top final match. Other rivals deserves something more too.

19,33,一代宗師The Grandmaster,Best Film,"THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE INTERNATIONAL CUT, NOT THE 'HARVEY WEINSTEIN' American VERSION:

It was finally time for the great iconoclastic Hong Kong director to turn to martial arts in his intense and atmospheric telling of the great grandmaster teacher, Ip man, and he doesn't disappoint.

Wong Kar-wai brings the poetic beauty of his ""In the Mood for Love"" to this Chinese action genre and executes it with a precise rhythmic heightening reminiscent of Sam Peckinpah at his best, while bringing out the experience of living through the Japanese invasion of China during WWII.

The cast is magnificent, especially Tony Leung as the Ip man and Ziyi Zhang as Gong Er who perfectly embodies a kung-fu mistress trying to avenge her father.

A Wong masterpiece to put on a level with his finest work!

PS: One particular reviewer earlier criticized the editing of this film which, to me, smacks of putting down the film for not being more conventional. Sometimes it is difficult to put aside expectations of what one wants a film to be in favor of what the actual film on the screen is. ""The Grandmaster"" is, in fact, brilliantly edited. Wong is, if nothing else, a perfectionist in taking years to mold his assembled footage into his own personal rhythmic poem, idiosyncratically emphasizing downbeats and rests as precise as a great composer. What you see here is Wong Kar-wai's personal vision, take it or leave it. I wouldn't change a frame, or a single edit. It strikes me as a perfect diamond by this exceptional, if eccentric, cinema artist.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3111600/?ref_=tt_urv
20,33,一代宗師,Best Art Direction,"The most under-appreciated films usually emerge later as gems, often 10, 20 or even 50 years later. For example, Citizen Kane didn't win an Academy Award but 20 years later, it was considered one of the greatest films made. The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928) was a critically acclaimed film when released but is really considered more of a gem today than 30-40 years ago. Like fine wine, films get better as they age. Once Upon in the West (1968) when released was celebrated in Europe but panned in the US. Twenty years alter, it is considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Grandmaster comes very close to these films.

The three reasons this film is panned: 1) People want action, the figure Ip Man represents action and this film breaks from traditional kung fu movies but in the same vein as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. In essence, it is just as good as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. There is plenty of action but martial arts fans want Jet Li, Donnie Yen or Michelle Yeoh. Hence, they will never give this film an 8, 9 or 10. Action is great, but it's second-rate to the true martial artist fan. 2), People find it complex. The plot is quite simple, really. I suspect it's more about reading prose and not realizing it's poetry. Plot is about Ip Man rising to the best in the South and to be challenged by the northern martial artists but war stops everything. half of the movie is about tradition and honor, not about martial arts. Definitely not about good guy beats up bad guy which draws most people's attention and praise. 3) Ip Man and Gong Er fall in a type of forbidden, unrequited love. It's bounded more by cultural beliefs than personal beliefs. But to many, this subplot slows or kills the action plot. But love isn't complicated, or at least we shouldn't see it that way.

On another final note, this film isn't about confrontation between the protagonist and antagonist. Rather, Ip Man doesn't really have an opposing challenge. His challenges are friends, as real martial artists become friends, as mentioned. They test each others' skills and build respect for each other, much like the test fight with Razor. It is the pretenders who fight, like Ma San. It is about honor and respect, not about violence.

Movie fans who want a real martial artist star will prefer Donnie Yen in Ip Man (2008) which is artistically almost as good a film. In contrast, The Grandmaster is better written, better acted and better cinematography, but Ip Man with Donnie Yen has better fighting scenes. Keep in mind, Bruce Lee never made great films, they were rather B type films but people love his iconic charisma. Many will like the film for the star, not the quality.

So like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, this film is mystical and really, martial arts is more a scenic subplot into a man and his world. Or what director Kar Wai Wong intended. Regardless, a question is that should one pan a film because of what it isn't? Or should one celebrate a film for what it is? A parent celebrates and loves each child, regardless of how different. How can we celebrate this film?

1. It's slow but that gives a chance to watch the direction and cinematography which is exquisite. One doesn't rush through The Louvre, but savors the moment. It's quite masterful and poetic. 2. The screenplay and script. Brilliantly done. The dialogue is simple in appearance but every other line has a double meaning. Not since Once Upon a Time in the West has a simple dialogue taken on so many directions. The viewer has to focus on the words and what they mean. 3. There is beautiful scenes, significant cultural symbolism but it is broken down simplistically, most of the symbolism is cultural. It's not hard to understand, just place yourself in another world. It's not a simplistic film like Rocky. Quite the opposite but yet the plot is quite simple, if you realize it's not just about kung fu. Watching Master Gong Yutian practice in the snowy garden was magnificent. The brothel scenes with the martial artists was surprisingly a wealth of characters, costumes and sets. 4. Acting is strong with Ziyi Zhang leading and maybe overshadowing Tony Chiu Wai Leung. To some, that's not sensible: why not a film to showcase Donnie Yen with real moves? Bu Donnie isn't as somber an actor. We see the pain and modesty of Ip Man through Tony Chiu Wai Leung. The plain expressiveness of the actors casts a shadow over the difficult history, the winter months as Ip Man narrates. Ziyi represents the forbidden martial arts, the family secrets, the traditional view of outsiders. Hence she has an important symbolism. Ip Man represents the new, the invention of Bruce Lee and exposure of Wing Chun to the world.

The ending was slightly out of place given the poetry of the film. We didn't need Ip Man to give his final quote, although it was snappy, it was out of place. Perhaps, just a fade from the photo shoot with the young Bruce Lee.

Just watch and appreciate artistic quality. Real martial arts fans will appreciate the descriptions and dialog over different styles of martial arts. This film won't be really in a Top 100 list of greatest films, but it comes close and should be in a top 250-500 list of great films. Or one of the 50 best films of the decade. A gem. It just isn't a traditional martial arts fan film, rather an Arts House film.

I'm not sure whether to give this film a 8.5, 9, 9.5but seeing the relatively IMDb scores (6.5 at this time), I'm boosting it to its rightful place.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3112765/?ref_=tt_urv

22,32,低俗喜劇Vulgaria,Best Film,"A top-notch Hong Kong comedy at its best, Pang Ho-Cheung's VULGARIA is a hilarious satire that pokes fun on the Hong Kong movie industry (particularly Category III genre) and of course, low-budget filmmaking in general.

The first two scenes are particularly the funniest ones that had me laughing nonstop. It opens with a sleazy producer named To Wai-Cheung (Chapman To) who is being interviewed by his old friend Professor Cheng (Lawrence Cheng) inside an auditorium filled with film students, to discuss about the nature of producing a movie. Among the hilarious part is how To compares his job as a producer to human pubic hair (a vulgar, but inspiring metaphor nonetheless).

Next up, is another memorable part on how To recounts an unfortunate incident in which he was forced to do something unpleasant for the sake of funding a movie. Introduced by his best friend Lui (Simon Lui), both of them head over to Guangxi and meets a triad head named Tyrannosaurus (Ronald Cheng) at a favorite restaurant. Tyrannosaurus has a peculiar taste, especially the way he introduces both of them all the so-called signature weird dishes. But nothing comes weirder than Tyrannosaurus' taste of ""woman"". Not human, that is but rather a mule. In order to seal the deal of getting the fund, both To and Lui must have sex with two mules specially brought over for them. And there's more: Tyrannosaurus is specifically wanted To to remake a 1976 period erotic classic CONFESSION OF A CONCUBINE and only wants his favorite star, Siu Yam-Yam (Susan Shaw) to play the leading role all over again.

So To calls out Siu Yam-Yam to propose his idea for the CONFESSION OF A CONCUBINE remake. But since the original version has aged over 30 years ago, it's natural that the now-older Siu Yam-Yam feels unpleasant to strip anymore (you'll get the picture). Nevertheless, Siu Yam-Yam rejects his offer, but To must finds way to fulfill Tyrannosaurus' pet project no matter what.

Enter wannabe starlet nicknamed Popping Candy (Dada Chan). During a fellatio involving some popping candies, Popping Candy has unexpectedly gives To a great idea about how to make Tyrannosaurus' dream comes true. By using CGI, he will combines Siu Yam-Yam's face and Popping Candy's busty body. His idea nevertheless prompted Siu Yam-Yam herself to agree for playing the role all over again. But of course, nothing comes smooth during the filmmaking process as To also juggles with his own personal problem involving his ex-wife (Crystal Tin) and his little daughter Jacqueline (Jacqueline Chan).

Blessed with a Category III rating, writer-director Pang Ho-Cheung has certainly goes rampant with lots of colorful, yet creative Cantonese profanities. Likewise, his brand of knowing humor hits the jackpot that lampoons from almost everything he can think of -- filmmaking, sexual harassment, Hong Kong educational system, 3D SEX AND ZEN parody involving Hiro Hayama and even Al-Qaeda reference. The result is uproariously funny.

Special kudos also goes to all the gamely playful actors involved here. Chapman To's comical performance is pitch-perfect, while Dada Chan is surprisingly likable enough as the endearing Popping Candy. The rest of the supporting actors perform their respective roles pretty good. Even the cameo appearances (Lam Suet, Miriam Yeung) are just as memorable. But the true standout is none others than Ronald Cheng, who excels in a tour de force performance as the crude and primitive triad head Tyrannosaurus. Each time he appears in a scene, he's a laughing riot to watch for.

No doubt VULGARIA earns its place as one of the funniest Hong Kong comedies ever seen in a long while, but the movie is still without its glaring flaws. Pang Ho-Cheung's energetic storyline is sometimes incoherent and also lack of focus. It's also quite a shame that he doesn't make use of Category III rating to showcase sex and nudity (especially those involving Dada Chan) which might disappoint genre fans.

And by the way, stick around after the credit rolls. Midway, there's more scenes afterwards and particularly the crucial one involved whether or not To is having sex with a mule.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2266938/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1
23,32,大上海,Best Art Direction,"Directed by one of the best directors of Hong Kong cinema industry, Wong Jing and starred by one of his favorite actors, the charismatic Chow Yun fat, who adds a new memorable performance to her legendary career,and wrapped by a cast full of stars such as Francis Ng and the legendary Sammo Hung and new rising stars as Xiaoming Huang, who amazing portraying the younger version of Chow Yun fat, literally becoming in him, and completing the cast with the talented and beautiful Quan Yuan, Li Yuan and Monica Mok. This film has overcame all my expectations becoming into one of my favorites from it's director, I love every photo gram from it and I dare to consider it a masterpiece.

The film tells the story of the rise to the power of Cheng Daiqi in the crime world in the Sanghai from the 30's and his impossible love story with Zhiqiu, a young girl who dreams in become in a famous opera singer, something that is forbidden for her, it also tells the efforts of Daiqi to defend Sanghai from the Japanese invasion.

The film pass through many different genres from melodrama, gangster cinema, action and romance, being divided in two parts.

In the first part of the film Wong Jing, using flashbacks, tells the humble origins of the main character and the his love story, using masterly camera movements and travelings to take the audience in a travel through time, accompanied by a beautiful photography by Andrew Lau and a wonderful score that is a key factor in the most important moments of the story to excite the audience.

scenes as the one in which a young Daiqi, played by Xaoming Hua, arrives to Sanghai and stares at the biggest building to the city trying to see the end of it where the camera ascends until the last floor in which an older Daiqi, played by Yun Fat, is contemplating the whole city and the later scene in which a traveling shows a young Daiqi sitting in front of his men just after become in the right hand of the crime boss in Sanghai, played by a great Sammo Hung, the then after the traveling become in the adult version of the character played by Chow Yun Fat, is a perfect and perfect visual exercise that unifies in a masterly way the past and the present of the story and the character.

The first act of the story ends with the spectacular sequences of the invasion of Sanghai by the Japanese army that reach it's climax in a scene that is pure poetry.

The second part of the film shows Daiqi defending Sanghai from the Japanese invasion leading us to an emotional and epic ending...

It's a movie which primarily focus on every little moment of an elderly woman, but it is never a dull moment as the first impression might seem. It's a movie which really drives you to care for the characters in a natural way as opposed to many films where they ""force"" you with ""natural"" gimmicks. No, this movie broke most typical western styles, but at the same time made it entertaining and thrilling.

It's a movie where there're no explosions, no foresight drama or no extreme twists... it's truly, a simple life, which showed me how simple it can be to be humble, and care for those we love.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2583999/?ref_=tt_urv

Suffice to say, both actors delivered riveting performances that kept me glued to my seat. What else can I say about this movie? Just watch it already.

It's about love. The power that love wields between two people who are in love and the control, twist, and even anguish that love sometimes will exert over us. Yes, the fight scenes were well filmed. Additionally the colors exploded violently from frame to frame, it was exceptional. I would be inconsistent if I however did not point out that if this film had a major Hollywood studio budget. Some of the CGI scenes would have looked slightly less choppy, and perhaps more money, would have helped to further polish an already outstanding movie. The Sorcerer and The White Snake is a rare gem, it is a love story told through art. I found the water sections in the opening of the movie simply stunning. Art and love translated through film, simply exceptional.

28,30,打擂台Gallants,Best Film,"Produced under Andy Lau's Focus Films with actor Lau Kar Tung on board as producer, directors Clement Cheng and Derek Kwok have a winner on their hands, as they exalt the spirit of what it means to never give up when the odds are stacked against you, and in some way live up that spirit of theirs when they had embarked to make this project which had clear risks. It will be extremely foolish to dismiss the film outright just because it has more elderly actors than youthful ones to draw the crowd, because as the adage goes, the oldest ginger is still the best, and this film is a testament to that. Look closely and you'll see the sheer amount of veteran, legendary talent even, assembled who hail from the Shaw Brothers kung fu film era, with even the opening credits with the silhouette fights, and the way characters are introduced, paying certain homage to an era bygone.

In essence, this purely Hong Kong film is an allegory of sorts to its peers in the market, where packaging and marketing are seen to be the be-all-and-end-all, rather than to rely on hard work to hone talent, or to compensate for the lack thereof. It tells of a people's indomitable spirit of not backing down, and to keep one's chin up in the face of tremendous competition, to work at what they are good at, and all will likely and hopefully be well.

As the story goes, we follow the adventures of Cheung (Wong You Nam), a lifelong loser who gets bullied from the get go in his life, and gets sent by his real estate company to a remote town to assist in acquiring leases from the townsfolk so that redevelopment works can start. Naturally he gets bullied, and gets rescued by the mysterious Tiger (Leung Siu-Lung), a disciple of the once great Master Ben Law (Teddy Robin) of the Gate of Law martial arts school, who has been in coma for the last 30 years. And it seems, like in Stephen Chow's Kung Fu, this small town hides a lot more martial arts exponents, such as Law's other disciple Dragon (Chen Kuan-Tai), who together with Tiger had tried their best to keep their Master's place alive by converting it to a Teahouse, while awaiting Ben's recovery.

Then there's Kwai (JJ Jia), the pretty lass who also hangs out at the Law's teahouse. Their collective backstory is something that got delivered through a fantastic animated sequence, and animation is something that gets peppered throughout the film as well when it gets down to fight sequences when deadly bone crunching blows get delivered. Since the film has in its plot the advent of the Hong Kong Martial Arts Open to seemingly promote the spirit of martial arts, as announced by rival and owner of a flashier sports club Master Pong (Chan Mai Wan), one will expect some spectacular kung fu action. The film more than delivers in this aspect, with the action choreographed by the renowned Yuen Tak, who cleverly did away with fancy wire-work, offering instead sparring sessions which are realistic and extremely riveting to watch, as the actors (most of whom have so many years of experience) put together some credible and exciting martial arts moves for the screen. Editing is also wonderfully done so that we get the best views at the front seats of a bout without the usual MTV-styled quick editing nonsense. I guarantee no matter how many martial arts films that you've seen, the ones here as choreographed will still blow your mind away.

Like a Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon itself, if you do not buy the first act, then wait for Teddy Robin, who single-handedly stole the show right out from everyone's noses. His comic timing is perfect, and the lines that he has, sheer wit, coupled with the fact that his character's disorientation after being out of action for so many years, is something that offers rip-roaring laughter. The directors, who co-wrote the story with Frankie Tam, breathe so much life into Master Law, that you can't help but on one hand be amazed by his crazy philosophy, and on the other just laugh at it, such as his proclaimed laws of combat in the order of Guts, Power and Skill, the rationale in his disciple recruitment strategy, and chiefly, that the reason to learn Kung Fu is to fight, not exercise – which has other, better alternatives. Robin, who also contributed to the movie's music, fills his character with so much youthful energy and exuberance, makes this one of his more memorable roles that he has tackled, and left everyone in the cinema crackling with glee each time he turns on his wit.

As the film explains early on, the boxing ring is a symbol of dignity and fame, and there can be only one victor and one loser. Clearly, Gallants is a winner in my books, and delivers knockout blow after knockout blow without relent. I had come with a mission to watch Hong Kong films, and this one clearly made my trip worthwhile many times over, coupled with so many hilarious moments to laugh along with. I hope it makes it to Singapore so that I can watch this on the big screen again, otherwise I'll patiently wait for its DVD release after it's done its theatrical and festival rounds. Highly recommended, without a doubt one of the best amongst the festival offerings if I may say so!",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2227214/?ref_=tt_urv
29,30,孔子 決戰春秋,Best Art Direction,"There has been some commotion around this movie concerning whether it did or did not force Avatar from the 2D screens in China. So many IMDb-voters thought it necessary to vote a '1' for this movie without even seeing it.

It's a shame because it is a really good movie. I wasn't sure myself if a story around Confucius would be able to entertain me for 2 hours but it surely did! It's a fascinating and emotional story about the later years of Confucius, played by Hong Kong-actor Chow Yun Fat. It's shows the man behind the myth.

I was very impressed with Chow's acting. I knew he was a great actor but this role is another milestone in his career. His Confucius is warm and gentle and you really feel his emotions. For his performance alone this film is worth watching.

I was impressed by the CGI, often having trouble distinguishing where the real, physical parts of the set ended and the computer generated world began. The cinematography is superb.

The story was complex but still digestible. The filmmakers threw up enough red herrings to keep me guessing while making it believable that Detective Dee could solve the case without huge leaps in logic.

I found Andy Lau's performance effective, but was particularly impressed by Carina Lau who played Empress Wu. Her performance was both subtle and powerful. She was mesmerizing anytime she was on screen.

As for the fight scenes, well... wow. I mean, really, WOW! The complexity of the final fight between Dee and the person he figures out committed the crime made fight scenes in the Bourne series look like child's play. Seriously. Now, there was wire work - I know some people really dislike that stuff in Kung Fu style movies, but it really worked in this setting. I hope people will give this one a chance. I really thought Detective Dee was fantastic!",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2488181/?ref_=tt_urv
31,29,十月圍城,Best Film,"Just had the pleasure of watching this, I had heard good things about it and when it popped up on a torrent site I leaped at the chance. Please note, I don't support piracy and downloading, but since this is not available stateside yet my options are limited. Needless to say, this one is a buy for sure on DVD, hopefully there will be a blu ray release with good subtitles at some point. This is a star studded period action film about the assassination attempt of Dr Sun Yat Sen in Hong Kong. The first hour of this movie is entirely about setting up the characters, making you understand them and care about them. In fact there is only one action scene in the first hour, which existed to drive the plot and define the motivation of the woman who would become one of the bodyguards. Don't worry, the kung fu awesomeness will begin, the entire second half of the movie is one very well done action sequence after another. But the set up really matters here, it is very engaging and later on when all these characters come together to protect Dr Sen, you care about each one and when some die, you feel it. The acting is excellent all around, many of the actors are major stars, such as Donnie Yen, Nicholas Tse, Leon Lai, and Tony Leung Ka Fai, but the film is an ensemble piece and each star disappears into their character, many of whom are playing against type. The action is top notch, as expected with Donnie Yen's involvement. Yen has a brutal fight with Cung Le that involves some very nice choreography and some parkour action as well. All of these scenes are enhanced by the fact that you care quite a bit if this character lives or dies. My only complaint would be the villain, played by Red Cliff's Jun Hu. I felt his character was a little over the top, I would have liked him to have been more in control. But it is a minor quibble in a film with a great many strengths. I highly recommend this one, check it out.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2197384/?ref_=tt_urv
32,29,十月圍城,Best Art Direction,"First of all, I'm not familiar with Chinese history, so I wouldn't say anything about its historical bases. Still, this movie worth the time with no doubt. No matter where you live.

Powerful, logical and heartbreaking. I say powerful because we got a well painted picture about the main characters in the first half. Yes, the movie does not only focus on the high profile action scenes and blood. That's one of its strengths. The audience - this time it's me - had enough time to acquaint the persons and like them. For this reason losing some of them is a heartbreaking effect in the second half. I think it's not a spoiler. Anyone can guess it who has seen the trailer. The acting is OK (some actors were great, especially Xueqi Wang) but my opinion is that the script and the director have done this movie for that it is. I really enjoyed that the movie has avoid to use mindless clichés, like ultimate fight of good vs. evil. The main bad character had also deep conviction that he has been doing the right thing for his country/highness. As it is so, for me, he was authentic in his role.

Now there's only one word has to be explained - logical. Unfortunately I can't do it without revealing some moments from the story, so I leave it to you. Find it out yourself. If you like heroic tales, you should love it.

I hope this movie will be released on DVD in my country, too.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2211227/?ref_=tt_urv

34,28,天水圍的日與夜,Best Film,"What do movies tell us about what kind of people we are? Imagine the following: you are an alien from outer space, who is about to get into the space ship to visit planet Earth. Before you leave, you are instructed to learn as much as possible about the people and their culture who live on this planet. Your homework: to watch all the movies produced in the last year.

Think about what kind of image you would get from looking at what kind of movies we produce and watch as people. There is an abundance of Hollywood movies. You might think we are all American. Or that we imagine to be super heroes. So much special effects. How would our lives look like if they were like Hollywood movies? But of course, our lives are most of the time nothing like Hollywood movies.

Showing a movie that just portrays how we are would be boring. Would it not? Ann Hui doesn't think so. She provocatively titled her latest movie The Way We Are. Ann Hui is perhaps the most gifted story teller in Hong Kong, at least when it comes to film making. The same way Ozu chronicled the lives of Japanese society, Hou Hsiao-hsien and Edward Yang documented the day-and-nights of Taiwanese people growing up, Ann Hui is the cultural biographer of Hong Kong.

When it comes to Hong Kong movies, most people might think of kung-fu stars, like Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan or Jet Li, or perhaps triad movies, made famous by John Woo, and more recently Johnnie To. Some might even think of Wong Kar Wai. But the films of Ann Hui are those who directly go to the core of what Hong Kong is about - but this core is as most of our lives perhaps unspectacular, mundane, and banal.

Ann Hui nevertheless manages to weave an incredibly rich story detailing the mundane lives of people in a part of Hong Kong that is often sensationalized: Tin Shui Wai. It's a part of town that is considered desolate, characterized by social problems, unemployment, with high buildings (some might think of them as Hong Kong's version of ""the projects"").

What is worth telling here is a story from a part of society that you otherwise would never see or hear. But that they don't exist in our popular imagination doesn't mean they exist, and it doesn't mean that we shouldn't know about. Most movies have spoiled the way we ""consume"" them: often slick, highly visualized, with something to grab our attention every three seconds (if not less). This movie by Ann Hui needs to be slowly taken in, with patience.

That is to say, our starting assumption should be that there are really no boring people. That every person has a story to tell, and that when they try to tell you their story, the least you could do is listen to them, with the patience and respect every human being deserves. Because, that's the way we are. Ann Hui, thank you for reminding us of this important lesson.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1992978/?ref_=tt_urv
35,28,三國之見龍卸甲,Best Art Direction,"Three kingdoms is a great Chinese masterpiece that is set in the era of the three kingdoms that ruled china. The cao, wu and liu dynasties were trying to unite china each under their own leadership and in a result it produces wars between the three houses for decades. The story in this movie is told from the Liu's point of view and my god what a story that is.

I don't know really why people are not giving this high ratings, it should be on the IMDb top 100. I guess most people that watch Chinese movies are in it because of the martial arts and people flying prospective. If you are looking for something like that then go watch house of the flying daggers or The Forbidden Kingdom because this movie is not about massive FX's and stunts. It simply tells a story with some battles shoved in. The movie is quite emotional and the acting was superb. As for the directing it truly is brilliant, the battles were directed with passion and ingeniousness with great sound effects and slowmo shots that makes it even more desirable to watch over and over again.

This is one movie that shouldn't be missed by Chinese history/mythology fans. Its a 10/10 and I don't care what other people might think, its just a masterpiece.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1877780/?ref_=tt_urv
36,28,赤壁,Best Visual Effects,"The Battle of Red Cliffs holds a special place in Chinese history and mythology. It was a decisive conflict which occurred at the end of the Han Dynasty, immediately prior to the period of the Three Kingdoms, and it was fought in the winter of 208/209 between the allied forces of the southern warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan and the numerically superior forces of the northern warlord Cao Cao.

The 2008 film, titled simply ""Red Cliff"", was deliberately timed for release in China in the lead up to the 2008 Summer Olympics and was a great success with Chinese audiences. One year later, the movie has a limited release in the West where the selling point is not so much the history (which is largely unknown outside China) as the director (Hong Kong's John Woo who is known for such Hollywood work as ""Broken Arrow"", ""Face/Off"" and ""Mission: Impossible 2"").

It has to be said that the Mandarin dialogue is leaden and much of the acting somewhat exaggerated, but a huge cast and considerable special effects - allied with the director's trademark style - makes the movie visually stunning with clever tactical manoeuvres, multiple battle scenes and considerable blood.

If it all seems a little confused to Western audiences, this is probably because we are seeing it in a rather different version to the original. In Asia, ""Red Cliff"" was released in two parts, totalling over four hours in length, whereas outside of Asia, the release is a single film of 'only' two and a half hours. For me, it's not up there with ""Hero"" or ""House of Flying Daggers"" but it is well-worth seeing and a pictorial treat.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2083137/?ref_=tt_urv
37,27,投名狀 The Warlords,Best Film,"Last night I had the opportunity to view one of the best films i've seen in a very long time. One that stays with you far after the closing credits. One that requires time after viewing to untie all the knots in your stomach.

Peter Chan's ""The Warlords"" is a period epic in every sense of the word. Chan covers a lot of ground here depicting war and the consequences thereof consisting of his anti-war sentiments. It tells the story of three ""brothers"" played brilliantly by Jet Li (Fearless), Andy Lau (Infernal Affairs) and Takeshi Kaneshiro (House Of Flying Daggers) who make a pact of brotherhood to one another that consists of killing anyone who harms one of the brothers and killing any brother who harms another brother as they lead an army through war after war taking over city after city.

It's incredible to watch the thought process of making vital decisions during a battle or within their own army to defy humanity for the ""greater good"". It shows the internal and external struggle of these decisions by opposing points of view. The emotions felt by these men translate in any language and leave you emotionally drained after watching the film through to its tragic end.

The cinematography is outstanding, the budget is huge, the directing brilliant and the war scenes brutal as can be. We're talking decapitations, gushing blood, limbs sliced off and a man being blown up by a cannonball. Chan is delivering a truth in the brutality of war rather than dressing it up to keep (most of it) realistic.

War is hell.... and this film will take you there and back. Highest recommendation.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1832972/?ref_=tt_urv
38,27,Anuson Pinyopotjanee （ C+偵探 ）,Best Art Direction,"Aaron Kwok is the reason to see this movie. He is the detective on the case. Soon it becomes clear that he isn't like any other private eyes in the movies. His motives for becoming one are personal. (I am not going to reveal what that fact is because it is important to the plot.) When he is hired by this man to find a woman who he claims is stalking him, things start to happen. He realizes that this is a serious case and really is on to something. Kwok does get some help from a friend in the police department (Kai Chi Liu). The interaction between him and Aaron provide most of the funny scenes. Still it is a one man show where it is fun to see Kwok investigating. Some elements of the mystery that has to be solved are pretty obvious. But I think that this is done on purpose since the focus is not the mystery it self but Kwok solving it and becoming a true private eye. The conclusion therefore is pretty decent and satisfying. There is a set up for a possible sequel. Well,if the Pang Brothers continue in this manner than they have my blessing!",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1784378/?ref_=tt_urv
39,27, （C+偵探 ） ( The Detective ),Best Visual Effects,"When the Pang bros unleashed Gin Gwai (The Eye) onto the world, it seemed like they'd launched themselves. All that rests now is a mediocre Hollywood career and a lot of disgruntled fans. Unrightfully so, because in their homeland the Pang bros keep on making first-class films, beating even their first outings. Oxide Pang is undoubtedly the better of the two and I'm always eagerly awaiting his solo projects. The Detective (C+ Jing Taam) is his latest effort, and again it doesn't let down.

It's a shame that The Pangs are getting such a bad reputation, because they are great talents in a rather stale industry. The problem with both brothers is that their films are often built around atmosphere, with lots of attention to the visual aspect of the film. When watching a Pang film, you can be sure to expect beautifully lit visuals and snappy editing. This puts a strain on the story of their films, urging people to complain. Sad but true.

The Pangs are known for their visually accomplished films, but it's really Oxide Pang who's responsible for this. The Detective is a visual treat from the first second till the final frame. Each shot is considered well, use of color and lighting is impeccable and some very nifty editing tricks are applied. One scene in particular stands out, where quick zooms and multiple angle changes make for quite a novel effect. Hope to see this used more in films.

One thing where both brothers often fail is their choice of music. Luckily they seem to be turning this around in their latest films. That said, the lengthy opening of The Detective did scare me a bit. I dunno what kind of local music Oxide used, but it sure made for a very wacky effect. Not in a bad way mind, but I'm glad he didn't keep it up for the remainder of the film. There's one particular scene where the mood of the film switches and from there on the sound design is strong and brooding, enhancing the atmosphere as a soundtrack should.

The basic premise of The Detective is pretty simple and oddly lacking any supernatural motive, which makes for a nice change. Aaron Kwok plays a wet behind the ears detective stumbling on a case that's hiding its true face. His connections with the police force help him with his work but when he starts running into bodies he is advised to stop meddling with the case.

From there on, the plot thickens and Kwok is thrown into a nicely tailored tale of deceit and paranoia. Aaron Kwok is confident enough to throw a nice one-man show, the supporting actors are decent but never do much besides fulfilling their role in the story. The story of the film is pretty straight-forward for a Pang film, with pieces of the puzzle slowly emerging at regular intervals. All lose ends are neatly tied together at the end, so my guess is this film should fare well with the earlier Pang adepts.

Oxide Pang succeeds again in making a visual masterpiece, although less experimental and in your face as his other films. This time around, the story is more focused and the choice of music is a whole lot better. Aaron Kwok is a good lead and the whole films flies by in no time. It's a shame that the Pang bros seem to have lost their audiences, as they keep on making interesting, if not superb films. 4.0*/5.0*",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1962847/?ref_=tt_urv
40,26,父子 After This Our Exile,Best Film,"The above title explains it all: when vengeance binds a father and a son. That was a Chinese idiom to describe the the fate that binds a father and son together. And this best describes the movie, After This Our Exile.

After migrated to Malaysia, Hong Kong director/scriptwriter Patrick Tam decided to tell a tale of gambling-addicted father (Aaron Kwok, which earns him a Golden Horse Award from Taiwan for Best Actor) and a son (the 9 year old newcomer Gouw Ian Iskandar) who was torn between his father and his mother (Charlie Yeung).

Set in Ipoh, Perak, the story begins with the boy sensing something is amiss when his mother was exceptionally nice to him in a morning before school. He found out that she was preparing to leave the home. He informs his father, and the couple had a quarrel in their neighborhood. She fails to run away.

When the mother told the father that she is leaving him due to his bad temper and gambling addiction, he decided to change. He brought the whole family for a cruise, and yet he goes gambling in the cruise. She left the family this time round, leaving the son and the father to face the problem.

Facing with harassment from the loan sharks and tonnes of unpaid bills, the father seek another alternative to get the money by go gambling in Genting Highlands. (Note: Genting Highlands is a tour/leisure resort in Pahang, Malaysia, where it consist of theme parks, shopping malls and casinos. Popular among Malaysians and Singaporeans.) He lost the money, leaving them with larger debts. To get the money, the father gets the son to steal valuables from their neighbors.

After This Our Exile is a simple yet sad tale about the struggles between a father and the son. The father was struggling from the loss of his wife, constant debts and his gambling addiction. The son was struggling with the life without his mother, which ends up being ripped off from the privilege of continuing his elementary education. This, somehow, truly reflects on what is happening in our society today.

Kwok takes a new exploration on the role of the father, who was short tempered, selfish, and more often, cried over spilled milk. Compared to his previous roles in other features, Kwok has given his fans and audience a new look on his skills for the past decade. Yeung's role as the mother can be added more, for there are rooms in theatrical version, which can explores more on the pains she has been through.

The 9 year old Iskandar was something new for the film. Without any acting backgrounds, he amazes the audience with his fine and innocent acting skills.

While the director's cut gives the audience a fuller view on the story, the theatrical version seems disappointing, for it left the audience with too much space to guess. This has somehow unable to brought up the 'vengence' that binds the father and son together, leaving a bittersweet aftertaste.

After This Our Exile sounds common to some, but it left the audience to re-examine the strained relationship between a father and the son.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1540650/?ref_=tt_urv
41,26,父子,Best Art Direction,"In a surprising twist of linguistics, the English name for Patrick Tam's latest carries a much deeper sense of atmosphere and tragedy than the simple Chinese title, translated more or less as ""father"". Well, a formal expression of the concept ""father"", but quite obvious either way.

And if one thing it isn't, that's obvious, for Exile serves as an adept reminder that even the most straightforward of stories may require multiple runs to fully appreciate.

Tam did items like Love Massacre in the past, and hasn't been much of a prolific artist in almost twenty years. This new release, rumored and talked about for over two , gives the director a respectable shot at a comeback, even though it probably isn't what he was going for, nor is it, frankly, the most astounding, earth-shattering drama to ever grace the silver screen.

But it is a sensible, intriguing affair, with quite excellent cinematography, a goodie bag's worth of various ingredients and an at least seldom-visited location setting.

Exile further depicts lean pop star Aaron Kwok in a superb melodramatic turn which has one regularly thinking to themselves, ""now that's acting"". Just for that kind of pondering about him, Exile surely has merit.

It further puts forth Charlie Yeung (Seven Swords, New Police Story) as Kwok's troubled life partner, with the couple, A Sheng and Lin, entering the stage as two Cantonese speakers (presumably from HK although that much is never revealed) in Malaysia. Kwok's character works as a cook in a restaurant, while Yeung depicts a homemaker, taking care of son Boy (Gouw Ian Iskandar). Something's amiss from the get go as Lin tries to get away from an abusive, yet strangely loving, relationship with her significant other, all superimposed over landscapes Tam and crew make clear are quite homey and comfortable.

For a minute there Exile veers close to the wave of cinematic psychedelia that came out of East Asia (and mainland China in particular) over the late 90's and early 2000's, with a flickering mood of non-place and slow, thoughtful unfolding of events to challenge those who didn't get enough sleep the night before.

However, this makes room for a more realistic mindset quite early. Lin indeed makes her escape, leaving Sheng and Boy to fend for themselves as we slowly witness them deteriorate further toward destitution in a pretty but cruel realm where, despite being surrounded by others, they are inevitably alone. Kwok does his job with flying colors, convincing us throughout that he's this lonely, well-meaning character that's so tragic for simply being completely unfit for the world in which we live. No matter what the guy does he can't get a break, from his crumbling family to bad debts that won't go away.

Everyone else doesn't seriously measure up to Aaron, with Yeung doing her best but ultimately failing to impress. She's OK, yet we like her a lot better in urban, rather than urbane, roles. Some supporting love comes via Qin Hailu (Durian Durian and the masterful Chicken Poets) as Lin's KTV lounge friend and boss. What ruins her appearance in Exile is the horrible Cantonese dub they slapped over her Putonghua lines, hence a reduction to a stand-in sideshow.

Our beloved Kelly Lin has returned at long last from her own mini exile, looking so different and mature we barely recognized the graceful lady. Sadly none of the bubbly Martial Angels stuff from back in the day here. She plays a prostitute granting Sheng temporary relief and haunting memories at the same time. And although appropriately emotional and chilling while engaged with him, Kelly's persona also ends up in a dead end much like most everyone in the film, leaving Aaron to carry it all himself.

Even the kid, Boy (Iskandar) doesn't pack too much punch despite showing promise. We wish him every success in the future, but feel there was more that could have been done with his role. As it stands, you feel for him in the few occasions where he starts to (quite genuinely) cry, yet not a lot beyond.

Exile, overall, can be touching at times and certainly there's those that'll find it very moving. It doesn't overwhelm with sheer sentiment, though, leaving its assets clear: firstly, there's Aaron in a prize appearance. Then, the mesmerizing Malaysian landscapes. Finally, that English title just compels one to reflect on what it all means. Taken in that context, After This Our Exile thrusts itself forward, defying a seemingly almost banal story and non-descript characters. Additionally, Tam makes sure to incorporate saucy adult elements like love scenes (not overdone) and language. In fact, more F-bombs here than in any other HK film we can recall recently.

This humanity is definitely a driving force, but not enough for grand success. Ergo, after all this isn't our latest classic, but it sure should be on your winter viewing list.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1536710/?ref_=tt_urv
42,26,夜宴,Best Visual Effects,"Definitely worth catching on the BIG screen, this is an epic about court intrigue in the Five Dynasties period, which follows in part the Hamlet setup of a murderous uncle usurper (You Ge) and his duplicitous queen (Zhang Ziyi), with an angry yet distant, brooding prince (Daniel Wu). The details and setting are different enough so that the new story carries its own weight and is interesting, however. The acting is strong (some excellent), the martial arts scenes memorable, and the sets are fantastic! This is not a fully realistic historical drama, by the way. Director Xiaogang Feng has crafted a modern art piece here, highly stylized in some parts, and often gory, especially the martial arts scenes, so if you can't stomach people flying and leaping like phoenixes (while disemboweling each other), skip it. The highly artistic feel of the film is kept somewhat in check by the gritty, used, and sometimes decaying feel of the palace, and more so by the tight, sparse dialog, the drama and the tension of the story. (Although following in the footsteps of highly stylized films like some of Zhang Yimou's, the focus returns very firmly to the story in this one, thankfully.) Similarly, the stunning beauty of parts of the film is balanced by the unmitigated ambition of the characters and their other dark flaws. These left the story with no single, simplified protagonist to cheer for  the very opposite of Hollywood formula. (The supporting role played by Xun Zhou might be an exception, but she's the very image of innocence and purity to a fatal flaw, and you pity her more than rooting for her.) The raw ambition, incestuous lust, jealous hate, betrayal and/or impotence darken nearly every character. While refreshingly different in this sense, it almost left me reaching for my goblet of hemlock. The Chinese title Ye Yan should have been translated as The Night Banquet rather than The Banquet (its English billing where I am), as the climax occurs at a midnight banquet unwisely set by the emperor at an inauspicious time, and it would have better reflected the darkness of the film.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1482048/?ref_=tt_urv
43,25,七劍 Seven Swords,Best Film,"Well, what to say what has not been said yet, saying that it's a magnificent masterpiece is just an understatement.

Beautiful, barbarian, sublime, lyrical, except for its cinematic scope it has nothing in common with profit-driven, highly flawed swordplay film ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" that has brought nothing interesting and fresh to the genre except for the obvious commercialization.

This movie was excellent, and really I cannot see how anyone who doesn't have ADD or any humanity cannot sit down and watch this movie.

A nice example of another re-invention of the Chinese swordplay movies. Seven Swords is also one of the bigger films of this genre since The Blade and the films of the Shaw Brothers.

The only thing I disliked was Donnie Yen (the only flaw on this film was the casting of his character)

I saw this film with a couple of friends, and let me tell you that it was vividly seen on their eyes that every single one was totally mesmerized by this, later we were talking mostly just about this film the whole week.

As for comparisons to Seven Samurai, while I must say I love that movie as well, I think this one has much more depth and raw humanity. It's much more emotional and inspirational to life... at least to me certainly.

This is out of question the cinematic accomplishment of the highest proportions.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1383330/?ref_=tt_urv

This movie has however, far exceeded my expectations. I was preparing myself to see another version of Crouching Tiger but was surprised to see a movie with a great story line, drama, and the best action that I have seen in a long time. My favorite characters would definitely have been the Wind Fire and Chu. Each character had a sad part of their life that made them so much human. The action, although very fast paced, made the viewer feel as though they were part of the fight and the moves much more realistic than flying to the top of a building. I am hooked and look forward to more Tsui Hark movies",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1305617/?ref_=tt_urv
45,25,Peter Webb （七劍） (Seven Swords),Best Visual Effects,"What i've seen simply can not be fully described, it's a movie full of emotions and heroism. Whoever directed this movie knows his craft even more than Kurosawa and Godard ever did. Incidentally when i already mentioned J.L.Godard, i must admit that i'm a bit perplexed why so many European critics constantly comparing this film to Godard's style... i don't remember Godard ever did an epic film like this. Anyway, this wuxia film cares more about the characters than most of the films of this genre i've seen in the past, including Touch of Zen or One-armed Swordsman, this gives them a very good development throughout the film.

Of course, the movie has a very challenging nature right from the very beginning as to the way how some of the fight scenes and story development being treated on the film. What i liked the most was the second half of the film because only then it started to give the meaning what the film is about... the characters! Not one scene or just a one single second of the film is wasted, everything there has the reason and meaning. The romance as much as the action of the film are evidently the most important and the most effective. It kind of shows the viewers that the romantic sub-plots is what this whole series is supposed to be about. Honestly, i found myself crying several times during the film, especially in the middle when Zhang Jingchu talks about love with so-yeon Kim, that scene is almost unbearable in terms of the emotional intensity induced mostly just by looking at both actresses's eyes and facial expressions and almost no dialogue(!)... strictly genius! Another (almost) cry inducing scene is right at the end when Hanzhiban decides which way to go, which is clearly one of the most important and emotional moments in the film.

The fact that this movie is in no way some popcorn is also one of the aspects i admired very much because it's much more demanding than usual wuxia films were used to be in the past. It tries to carry several strong messages and images that can very easily grave in your mind, so i must warn you all that it's a very memorable film that you won't certainly forget so soon.

The movie is an obvious antithesis to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hero or House of Flying Daggers, strictly speaking, it's one of the most realistic wuxia films out there and far better than any one of those futile attempts at this genre. But on the other hand this is also a movie that relies on the imagination and acuity of intelligence of the viewer. What we have here is a very intelligent movie that goes against many expectations as i noticed, and that's a good sign i think because i believe that best and the strongest films are usually those that situate themselves on the border between love and hate.

However, be aware that if you find yourself entirely immersed in this fictional world of seven swords throughout the movie you won't be disappointed in its powerful end... and trust me, it'll leave you wanting more. A perfect testament of the perfect movie! It's without any doubt one of the best wuxia films that appeared in the recent years but i'm sure that only the time will tell that it's probably destined to be the best wuxia film in the Asian film-making history. Just wait if you want or see this fascinating and magnificent jewel immediately!",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1328271/?ref_=tt_urv
46,24,2046 ,Best Film,"2046 was directed by Kar Wai Wong, who also directed In the Mood for Love. This film is also lyrical, deliberately paced, and very romantic.

Without giving too much away, the film takes place in Hong Kong and Singapore in the 60's. The main character, Chow, is a writer and womanizer. Part of the story takes place in his work, a science fiction tale called 2046.

The story is told out of sequence, with past and present jumbled. In a clever use of irony, we gradually understand that the future is being used to tell the past. Some scenes are presented early, in a way that is confusing until the context is presented later.

There are 3 female characters who are in his life, and the story is segmented accordingly.

The cinematography is beautiful. Interestingly, Wong uses 3 colors nearly exclusively: Blood red, sea green, and yellow. Sometimes he will use light to make those colors stand out, other times it is the objects themselves which are in that color.

I would characterize the story as one of love and loss. There is one poignant scene where, after he realizes what has been happening, he states that timing is crucial in love.

The film is well acted, the characters are understandable if not necessarily ones we can identify with, and the story gradually allows itself to be revealed, a peek here and a peek there, until all the pieces fall into place.

Turn off the lights, cuddle up with a glass of wine, and see this one. Well worth it.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1252872/?ref_=tt_urv
47,24,2046 ,Best Art Direction,"Several years in the making and highly anticipated, _2046_ (2004) should pacify director Wong Kar Wai's fans, at least, for its end-of-an-era feel and look. At its core, this is a decidedly (or deceptively) simple movie, in spite of its fractured and non-linear narrative. It tells the tale of an emotionally wrecked man, Chow Mo Wan (played by Tony Leung), a reprised character from Wong's critically acclaimed earlier oeuver, _In the Mood for Love (2000)_, and the many beautiful women he keeps and fails to keep, in a time-space continuance that is laden with sepia-tinted memories: a monologue, if you will, of Chow's torrid love affairs, love spats, and the ensuing heartbreaks resulting, no doubt, from the pangs of a failed liaison Chow is trying to escape. It'd appear that the failed relation with Su Lizhen (Maggie Cheung) in _In the Mood for Love_, who has a ""special appearance"" in this film, has changed Chow irrevocably, which is key to understanding Chow's troubled soul.

But it is not a sequel necessarily, per se, to _In the Mood for Love_. This film can still be watched on its own, though it'd certainly help if you could link moments in _2046_ to the director's earlier works, for it's laden with jumbled continuity (take the character of Lulu, for example, first seen in _Days of Being Wild (1991)_), hidden meanings (read: Neo-Godardian) and other fun stuff, sorta an insider's joke, if you dig such esoteric things. But I digress. And it's been said that this is a culmination of all the previous filmic experience of director Wong (bordering on narcissism); hence its ""end-of-an-era"" feel and look is duly appreciated and a point well taken.

In _2046_, Chow's isn't an easily likable character owing to the frailty and the vagaries of his own personal emotions and peccadilloes, but that makes him only human and real, and his character, believable. Take the following exchange:

Su Lizhen (Gong Li) to Chow Mo Wan (Tony Leung): Do you know my past?

Professional gambler Su (she who is of the same name as that of Maggie's character in _In the Mood for Love_) asked Chow, dissonantly, questioning the latter essentially whether there is a future for the both of them, if he cannot forget his past. And it's for the same reason, or so we're led to believe, that Bai Ling (Zhang Ziyi) is left devastated, as Chow cannot treat her any differently from the scores of other women he's seeing; hence eliciting the following memorable line from Bai which I'm sure speaks to most of us one way or another:

Bai Ling (Zhang Ziyi) to Chow Mo Wan (Tony Leung): You may not like me. But I'll like you all the same.

What fools we are made by love. :)

Contrasting Chow as a man who dwells in the past and in need of closure to move on, Tak (Kimura Takuya) isn't ambiguous when it comes to matters of the heart.

Tak (Kimura Takuya) to Wang Jingwen (Faye Wong): I do not know what your answer may be. (I dread to know.) But I need to know.

Here is a man who is not afraid to love and says his love. And he needs to know if his love is unrequited. And in seeking happiness, the message seems to be that there is no other way. Now why does this remind me of all the sorry tales with which we are all-too-familiar with men-who-cannot-commit-or-decide? :) And so the film is thusly replete with impressions of repeated variations of the same theme: the pointlessness of returning to the past. Which is why we have the following line:

Bai Ling (Zhang Ziyi) to Chow Mo Wan (Tony Leung): Why can't it be like before? (The same reason why nobody returns on the 2046 train, in Chow's sci-fi novel of the same name. Seen in this light, it is also a double-entendre for director Wong: Why can't this film be like the one before in the form of _In the Mood for Love_? Where does he go from here?)

Those familiar with Wong's earlier works will notice his signatures throughout: quick cutting, slow motion, fast motion, freeze frames, black and white, tilt shots, color filters, neon-sign lighting, aided ably by three able cinematographers. Production value of _2046_ is expectedly top-notch. Music by Shigeru Umebayashi is haunting and sets the right mood. Zhang Suping (William Chang Suk Ping) does a wonderful job in creating an enrapturing atmosphere set in the late '60s.

How great it is, in an otherwise desolate world of unease, vulnerability, hopelessness, and pathos, we have directors such as Wong to feast our senses. Highly recommended.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0950510/?ref_=tt_urv
48,24,2046 ,Best Visual Effects,"I went to watch 2046 after reading millions and millions of interviews and reviews... seriously, it was really difficult to keep an open mind about a movie as talked about as this... imagine 5 years of anticipation.

I started watching trying my very best to keep an open mind, but after a while... i realize i din have to, gradually, my mind just goes on this journey with the story, gone were the reviews and interviews and comments. During the movie, i did not think about anything else except wat was happening in the movie. There is so much in this movie that i think i could write a novel about it.

This movie is about perceptions and memories. how a memory can dictate the way a person lives his or her life. The stories of the many girls are seen thru the eyes of the charismatic and talented Tony Leung. There are many girls in his life. All these girls have a story, a story as seen and perceived by Zhou Mu Yun. 

The first story would definitely be the story of the first Su Li Zhen (Maggie Cheung) and Zhou Mu Yun, this is the story that shaped Zhou's life, even though in this movie, Maggie only appears in a few shots. but the basis is all laid out in ""In the Mood for Love"". 

The second story is lulu's (Carina Lau) story. The meeting described by Zhou took place in the time span after ""Days of Being Wild"". I find it such a pity that Wong Kar Wai edited out so much of Lulu's story. I would really wish to have seen more of it.

Then there is the story of the second Su Li Zhen in Singapore. The mysterious woman who wears one black glove. Zhou finds new solace in her. Using her to fill up the gap left by the first Su.

The saddest story in in movie will have to be Bai Yun's(ZHang ZiYi). She definite loves Zhou with all her heart, but he treats her like a pro. At some point in the movie, i wanted to slap both Bai and Zhou. Bai for being so lovelorn, and Zhou for being so stupid, the girls he love wouldn't leave with him, now the girl that loves him so much, he refused her over and over.

The last, and definitely my favourite story would definitely be Wong Jing Wen's(Faye Wong), any mandarin speaking person would know that Wong Jing Wen is the moniker Faye Wong went with when she first started singing. Anyway... all these while i never thought Faye could act, but i guess with no anticipation, there wont be disappointment. And Faye proved that her portrayal of the hotel proprietor's daughter. Wong is the only woman in the movie that is not romantically linked to Zhou, although it was hinted that he was in love with her. Wong and her Japanese boyfriend(Takuya Kimura) were in love but Proprietor Wong refused to even meet the boy. Undaunted Takuya asked Wong to leave with him, but her refusal to give him an answer span the very basis of 2046, which Zhou aptly named ""2047"" in the movie. *grinz*

*Self-Indulgent Note* I am the Biggest fan of the late Jeanette Lin Tsai from the 50's Cathay era. And i have always felt that Faye looks a whole lot like her. But i will be kissing the ground that Wong Kar Wai step on, because he managed to capture Jeanette Lin's essence in Faye. Unwittingly no doubt, but it helped me indulged in a memory that i wish to forever keep in 2046.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0948844/?ref_=tt_urv
49,23,PTU (PTU),Best Film,"I saw a screening of PTU at UCLA tonight, with the director (and his translator) in attendance. I found the film to be a bit slow in spots, but I was willing to go along with the deliberate pace and slow burn of the film. I think in this country we're way too spoiled on visual chaos, with most studio films thrusting a car chase or a slapstick joke in our face every two minutes or so. It doesn't have to be that way. The film was shot beautifully and there is a quiet cool about the whole thing, very reminiscent of a Lee Marvin vibe as someone else here pointed out.

To did stay to answer questions after the movie, and although this did not alter my opinion of the film it did make me appreciate it even more. It was shot over the course of two years, while he would stop to make other commercial films; some actors gain or lose weight on screen! The budget only came out to $400k U.S. Several of the actors were actually crew people from his other films. One person asked him how he made his cinematography choices (i.e. the constant pools of light) and he laughed and said it was strictly budgetary; they couldn't afford to dress every set and they only had a few overhead lights, so voila! I think the limitations of what they had to work with only make the film stronger, much like Jaws is a better movie because the shark always broke down.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0740420/?ref_=tt_urv

Nov 04, 2012
I didn't hate this movie at all, in fact its heart is definitely in the right place as this is a sweet story about an old prostitute and seeing her ups and downs, using historical Hong Kong events as the backdrop. Whether it be the stock market crash, the economy collapsing, etc. But, and this isn't a slight against the movie itself of course, as I am not from Hong Kong, the film will probably be a whole lot better to people who lived through the same events as Sandra Ng's character did. Perhaps it would resonate emotionally with them the way it didn't with me. And, again, this isn't a slight against the film itself. But the film is still pretty sweet and Sandra Ng does a great job at bringing a lot of heart and warmth to the character. It also helps that she is a very funny woman when she needs to be. Sandra simply adds a lot of likability to the character and she makes the film, in spite of its weaknesses, fun to sit through, even if I wouldn't say that it's a good movie. Another problem with the film is that isn't really all that funny, it has its funny scenes and moments but they're never really truly hilarious. The writing isn't great but, again, it is elevated by Sandra Ng's inspired performance. The movie also looks and feels like a low-budget affair but I can't complain about it too much, because I've seen low-budget films that were excellent. The problem doesn't lie in it feeling and looking low-budget, the problem lies in the quality of the dialogue and the lack of comedy. It isn't all bad, Sandra Ng does a great job in this film and it also has its funny and sweet moments. So while it's not perfect, there's still enough here to make this an average film at best.",https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/golden_chicken/reviews?type=user

52,22,Hero,Best Film,"Some reviewers have suggested that the storyline of this movie is a bit plodding and portentous, and I'd be willing to allow that. But even if this film had absolutely no plot to speak of, I would have considered the money I plunked down yesterday to see ""Hero"" to be money well-spent, because I have been witness to some of the most achingly beautiful film-making I've ever seen. As in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" the characters here fly through the air and dance across water, but ""Crouching Tiger"" surely could have benefited from the sublime camera eye of ""Hero."" One scene of swordplay in particular that takes place in a grove of trees amongst swirling yellow leaves almost stopped my heart in my chest: It was that gorgeous. And yes, there is a plot also, one that involves various assassins with names like Sky, and Broken Sword, and Flying Snow. I have to admit that the tales and counter-tales told were a bit confusing at first, but by the time the film is over, all the pieces have fallen into place, and this chapter of ancient Chinese history has assumed a truly mythical quality. At a time when movie theaters show a lot of utter dreck, we ought to be supporting movies like this.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0962569/?ref_=tt_urv
53,22,英雄,Best Art Direction,"The concept of this show is about people with special powers similar to mutants in the Marvel universe. And how the characters cope with it and what they decide to do with it. The main drive of this show isn't necessarily the the superpowers, but the subconscious and the philosophical aspects that revolve around power. Unfortunately this is one of those shows that has a very captivating and entertaining first season, but goes downhill from there. It probably has to do with the fact that after the first season it was first planned to introduce new characters with brand new main characters with just Suresh (who is sort of the Beast character from the Marvel universe without the furriness). Which didn't go into effect because they wanted to keep the main cast that become dis-likable and annoying as the seasons drags on. The writer strike could have been a big factor why the show started to go downhill after season 1. I think season 2 was the most boring season of all. Season 3 it sort of picks up, but just about everything is so inconsistent with the story and the character that it takes away a lot form the experience. The 4th season revolves around a mutant carnival and they just seemed to drag that on way too much. And the constant love, hate relationship between Claire Bennet (Hayden Panettiere) and Noah Bennet (Jack Coleman) gets really really annoying...Like super annoying and irritating. As a matter of fact most of the chemistry that starts out strong in the first season goes downhill. The story gets poorly written for each season after one that even the characters decisions and motives makes no sense sometimes. Especially the villains in the shows, including Sylar. And to increase the running time of the show, it has multiple story arcs that doesn't go anywhere. One of the most disappointing part about the show is the showdown between Peter and Sylar. The constant plot-holes and tons of time paradoxes when it comes to time travel doesn't make things better. Overall this is a show that has a good start but gets worse and worse with each installment. Who knows, maybe just maybe the fifth season could have been a boost with the world knowing about super humans and might go in the direction like ""True Blood"" except people with super powers going out into the public. And Sylar's redemption might have been cool to watch. To sum it up it's one of those shows that soars skyward with the first season and spirals downward. I give this show a 6.4/10 because I found some of the philosophical aspects to be intriguing.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3038987/?ref_=tt_urv

Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.

Bob Logan (Kris Kristofferson) and Ernie Wiatt (Treat Williams) are border-patrol officers in a remote part of southern Texas, which means that it is their job to find things in the desert. During the course of ''Flashpoint,'' which opens today at the National and other theaters, they come across a drug-smuggling operation, a stalled car with two attractive women inside, and a buried jeep containing very mysterious and controversial cargo. It is this last discovery that turns ''Flashpoint'' from a good-humored buddy movie into a conspiracy story - a chilly, paranoid fantasy of a sort no longer fashionable on the screen.

One reason why such films have fallen from favor is the ultimate absurdity of most of the theories they propound. ''Flashpoint'' isn't as far gone as ''Winter Kills,'' which is still the genre's reigning champion, and it has its provocative aspects, but it certainly makes a leap or two. That the audience will be way ahead of the screenplay (by Dennis Shryack and Michael Butler, based on a book by George La Fountaine), not to mention ahead of Logan and Wiatt, doesn't mean that the film is without its surprises. The plot takes enough hairpin turns to keep anyone guessing.

Sign up for the Movies Update Newsletter: A weekly roundup of movie reviews, news, stars and awards-season analysis.

You needn't know that William Tannen, who directed ''Flashpoint,'' is a director of commercials, with credits including the single most expensive advertisement spot ever filmed (it was for Diet Coke) to recognize his command of the advertising idiom. When the officers find a dust-covered car stalled somewhere in the desert, the camera swirls around it as loftily as if this were a brand-new Plymouth in Monument Valley. The whole movie, which was photographed by Peter Moss, looks good, even the scenes that don't have to. An opening scene of Mr. Williams in the shower, as he suffers from a hangover, is all bright, crisp, close-up visuals, in notable contrast to the wretchedness the character is supposed to be feeling.

Mr. Tannen doesn't link the film's two heroes closely, visually or otherwise; though they are supposed to be devoted friends, Mr. Kristofferson's Logan and Mr. Williams's Wiatt are individually striking but don't have much team spirit. However, Mr. Tannen's strength is his ability to grab his audience's interest quickly and to hold on to it, even by the most superficial means. Even when the movie doesn't entirely make sense, it manages to be effective.

As the two women who turn up in the stalled car, Tess Harper and Jean Smart have the most thankless roles. They're window dressing at best, and at worst red herrings, since the hints that they may have something to do with the conspiracy plot come to nothing. This part of the movie revolves around a group of blue-suited Government functionaries, led by the mysterious and rather overdone Carson (Kurtwood Smith), who tells Logan, ''Every morning I wake up and thank God for drugs and subversion and murder - because without them we'd all be out of a job.''

In the face of such cynicism, Mr. Kristofferson and Mr. Williams maintain a tough-guy geniality and an even keel. Each of them makes the most of his relatively narrow role, with Mr. Kristofferson as the seasoned pro given to salty aphorisms, and Mr. Williams as his more idealistic and arrogant young sidekick. Roberts Blossom turns up briefly but effectively as a snappish old coot living in a desert trailer. And Rip Torn has a high old time playing the local sheriff, obviously enjoying both the thickness of his accent and the vagaries of his role. In a closing scene that has him disclosing one last detail of the conspiracy, both Mr. Torn and his character just about take the cake.

KUNG FU + SOCCER = lots of laughs!!

Funny funny funny. And that's coming from a non-soccer fan.

Great performances here in this blend of comedy and high flying soccer action. Stephen Chow as Sing packs one hell of a kick!! His chemistry with Ng Man Tat (Golden Leg) is natural as it is in most of their films together. Plus, Sing's Shaolin brothers provide for a lot of comic relief!! From their soccer training to the championship game, there are really cool kung fu soccer shots, a mix of Matrix/Crouch Tiger special effects and it delivers. Oh, and Vicki Zhao literally steals this in the end (you have to see it).

The Bruce Lee goalie scene is priceless. This movie can definitely be watched several times with even more satisfaction!",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0814983/?ref_=tt_urv
56,21,男人四十,Best Art Direction,"I've known Ann Hui to be a excellent director for drama films. Most of her film subjects have touch matters such as family dysfunction, ethical and moral dilemmas that afflicts individuals. One of her films Song of Exile (Maggie Cheung) deals with the relationship of a Chinese-Japanese daughter and her Japanese mother. The characters in Ann Hui's films are fleshed out in depth making them 3 dimensional to the audiences.

Lam Yiu Kwok (Jacky Cheung) is a Chinese Literature school teacher who is in his mid-40's (hence the Chinese title 'Lam Yan Sei Saap' literally meaning 'Man At 40'). Despite being educated and graduating successfully, he opted to teach literature thinking that he could inspire his students to appreciate the art. His friends from high school have gone on to own successful businesses, rich corporate executives, and even stockbrokers. Somehow Yiu Kwok feels inadequate when he meets them at a reunion dinner.

His wife Lam Man Ching (the late Anita Mui) is a homemaker blessed with two teenage sons; one in university and another a high schooler. She is caring and loving towards her family. She even shares her husband's passion for literature; they sometimes recite verses of poetry. However she hides a buried secret. It became apparent when her old lover returns into her life; the reason for that secret. He on the other hand is suffering from a terminal disease and she wants to help him out by caring for him till he passes on. Man Ching feels that helping him can resolve old wounds or perhaps she felt vindictive and wanted to laugh at his dying body?

Yiu Kwok is furious that the past wounds has come back to haunt him and Man Ching. This is made even worse when she agreed to care for her dying old flame. He lets her to devices and delves deeper into his teaching. This leads to him forming a relationship to a student (devilishly played by Lam Kar Yan). She is a nubile girl who has the hots for her teacher. Yiu Kwok feels objected to the Lolita-esque affair he is having but can temptation overcome his senses? This leads to Yiu Kwok reevaluating his life and noticing how inadequate it is. The final moments of the film seems to have the characters resolving loose threads but it has also created new life paths that may require a painful sacrifice. I can't help but feel for Yiu Kwok, shedding a tear for Man Ching when both husband and wife came to an inevitable conclusion.

The characters in July Rhapsody has such deep depth, that they could just jump out of the screen; the audience can identify with the issues that are afflicting those individuals. All the actors gave a wonderful performance especially the central characters whose stories are tightly interwoven.

I've never seen Jacky Cheung do a better dramatic performance and did well here. Anita Mui has never failed to light up my eyes whenever she comes on screen. Her poetry recital reminds me of one of her film scenes in Rouge where her character Fleur recites love poems. That film itself was one of Anita's best. For her performance in July Rhapsody, the feeling is bitter sweet as not only did she give a memorable performance, it was also the last film that she ever made.Anita passed on in following late 2003 as a result of cervical cancer. Ironically, the film's conclusion although not that tragically sad had me bawling for Anita as the Chinese community and the rest of the world can never see such an actress like her again.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0863741/?ref_=tt_urv
57,21,2002 ,Best Visual Effects,"In Hong Kong, the special force of the police known as 2002 is composed of the twenty-two year-old cop Chiu (Nicholas Tse) and his ghost partner and they fight against supernatural phenomena under the guidance of the mystic Paper Chan (Kar-Ying Law).

When the fiend Water Ghost (Alex Fong) possesses Fung seeking revenge against Chiu, he has to battle against the evil spirit trying to protect also his friend.

The melodramatic ""2002"" blends action, sci-fi, fantasy, fight scenes, drama, romance, comedy, free merchandise of a bank and an ice-cream brand and cheap philosophy; the result is an enjoyable, but very confused movie, with weird rules and no explanation for the ghosts and fiends in Hong Kong.

58,20,榴槤飄飄 (Durian Durian),Best Film,"I thought Durian Durian was an exceptionally charming film. I believe that in this film Fruit Chan has done what lots of movies fail to do, which is to take on a stereotype character, deal with it and then present its flip side in such a humanising and tender way.

The film is largely about a Chinese call girl in HK, and her exploits are seen through the eyes of a little girl living in the back lanes where the call girl works. while this makes for a half-decent premise, Chan takes the film on an arc midway, just as one begins to settle into the setting and characters, and the film begins to explore a richer, subtler and charming side to this girl's life.

The film starts off feeling very urban - the camera is often hand-held, its movements rapid and its compositions documentary like and voyeuristic. however, as the characters unfold and become more and more well-rounded, so too does Chan's visual style. the cinema verity feel is replaced with a measured, elegant style. stillness and lush winter photography dominate, and by the time the picture ends, one has the feeling of being transported to an entirely different place, seeing before one, an entirely different character.

I enjoyed this film, very, very much. the manner in which it handled the character of the sympathetic prostitute reminds me very much of Jean-luc Godard's treatment of Nana Kleinfrankenheim in Vivre Sa Vie - it was measured, not sappy, in some ways magical, in other ways thoroughly real.

Trust me. this is a good, good film.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1005593/?ref_=tt_urv
59,20,花樣年華,Best Art Direction,"I think that New York Times film critic Elvis Mitchell wrote the best one line review of In the Mood for Love when he said that it is ""dizzy with a romantic spirit that's been missing from the cinema forever."" How true those words are! Truly romantic films are so rare these days, while films that include plenty of sex and nudity (which are often portrayed in a smutty and gratuitous manner) abound. So, given this cinematic climate, Wong Kar-wai's latest film feels like a much needed breath of fresh air. In the Mood for Love is about the doomed romance between two neighbors (""Mr. Chow,"" played by Tony Leung and ""Mrs. Chan,"" played by Maggie Cheung), whose spouses are having an illicit affair, as they try ""not to be like them."" But after hanging out with each other on lonely nights (while their spouses are away ""on business""/""taking care of a sick mother""), they fall madly in love, and must resist the temptation of going too far.

Several factors are responsible for making In the Mood for Love a new classic among ""romantic melodramas,"" in the best sense of that term. First, the specific period of the film (i.e. 1960's Hong Kong) is faithfully recreated to an astonishing degree of detail. The clothes (including Maggie Cheung's lovely dresses), the music (e.g. Nat King Cole), and the overall atmosphere of this film evokes a nostalgia for that specific period. Second, Christopher Doyle's award-winning, breathtakingly beautiful cinematography creates an environment which not only envelopes its two main characters, but seems to ooze with romantic longing in every one of its sumptuous, meticulously composed frame. Make no mistake about it: In the Mood for Love was the most gorgeous film of 2001. (It should also be mentioned that Wong Kar-wai's usual hyper-kinetic visual style is (understandably) toned down for this film, although his pallet remain just as colorful.) Third, there is the haunting score by Michael Galasso, which is accompanied by slow motion sequences of, e.g. Chan walking in her elegant dresses, Chan and Chow ""glancing"" at each other as they pass one another on the stairs, and other beautiful scenes which etch themselves into one's memory. The main score--which makes its instruments sound as though they're literally crying--is heard eight times throughout various points in the film and it serves to highlight the sadness and the longing which the two main characters feel. Fourth, Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung both deliver wonderful performances (Leung won the prize for best actor at Cannes) and they manage to generate real chemistry on screen.

The above elements coalesce and work so nicely together to create a film that feels timeless, ""dizzyingly romantic,"" and, in a word, magical. In the Mood for Love, perhaps more than any other film of 2001, reminded me why it is that I love ""going to the movies."" And I guess that is about the highest compliment that I can pay to a film.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0406270/?ref_=tt_urv
60,20,特警新人類2 ,Best Visual Effects,"Review: When I saw that Jackie Chan had produced this movie, I was expecting the young actors to be doing some amazing Kung Fu with some great stunts but it turned out to be about a bunch of gun tooting teenagers with an attitude. Its very fast paced and I didn't know who the goodies or the baddies were half the time because everyone kept on killing each other. Anyway, the film is based around Inspector Chan who isn't really taken seriously in his department, so to prove that he can take-down a bunch of arm dealers, he creates a young elite force to work for him. They then go up against the notorious young teenagers who are not afraid to kill whoever crosses them. The gang boss who controls the whole operation, goes toe to toe with the elite force and the showdown at the end is definitely worth a watch. Personally, I switched of from the film after a while because it seemed a bit messy. There was just too much going on at once and the dark tone of the film made it feel a bit seedy. With that aside, I can understand why it went down well in its native country because it does feel like a cult movie but for this day and age, it did seem a bit dated. I also found it hard to connect to any of the characters, except for the inspector who put in a great performance so it has to get the thumbs down from me. Disappointing! Round-Up: This movie was directed by Benny Chan who made the great Shaolin and has directed a few movies with Jackie Chan which include New Police Story, Robin-B-Hood and Who Am I? I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/thriller/comedies starring Nicholas Tse, Stephen Fung, Sam Lee,Eris Tsang, Daniel Wu and Jackie Chan. 3/1",https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/genx_cops/reviews?type=user
61,19,細路祥 (Little Cheung),Best Film,"Fruit Chan, the director of this second film of a triology about Hong Kong before and after the ""handover"" (at 1997, when Hong Kong was switched from a British colony to a special administrative region of China), is a rare and truly wonderful treat. The story is about the coming-of-age of a pre-teen boy ""Little Cheung"", the son of a street-wise owner of a restaurant in the Mongkok area (think Queens in NYC or Mission in San Francisco) and shares the name of a famous Cantonese opera singer. He meets all sorts of characters through helping his father delivering foods to regular customers - a pathetic gang leader, prostitutes, aging owners of funeral homes - and a girl who recently came from China illegally. While not able to study because of her illegal status, the girl ""Ah Fan"" ends up forming a ""partnership"" with Little Cheung to deliver foods (and share the tips) which develops into a memorable friendhship for both.

Chan's style is bare and touching, and has a tone that is neither moralistic or judging - no small achievement for a movie that aims to be a social commentary. It simply protriats the tough reality of life through the eyes of a young boy whose goal in life, like most Hong Kong people, is to make more money and satisfy their materialistic needs. Everything else that may touch one's own deeper inner feelings is underplayed or simply hidden.

Although none of the actors in the film is professional, the acting, especially the boy who played ""Little Cheung"", is superb. There are many references to local culture that may be difficult for non-native audiences, and there are also hints of storylines that come from the two other films (""The longest summer"" and ""Durian Durian""). But for anyone who wishes to go behind the Hong Kong ""genre"" and get a real sense of how Hong Kong people live, Fruit Chan's films are excellent starting points.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0702760/?ref_=tt_urv

Eric Tsang and Nicholas Tse gave the performances of their careers as former Triad member Mountain Leopard and rascal Smokey. The story was an odd one but it had some symbolism. Mountain Leopard carries a half-smoked cigarette as a memento from a long lost love. Even Stephen Fung gave out a great performance as the young Mountain Leopard (in flashback mode).

63,19,奚仲文（心動）,Best Visual Effects,"There's a tempting idea at the heart of ""Tempting Heart,"" but it goes askew almost right away, and doesn't fall into focus until near the end. It's as if the filmmakers started to make one kind of film, rethought the concept while it was underway, and then changed metaphor-boats in midstream.
The film is three-way produced by the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Japan. That might explain the messy and tamped-down plot threads. ""Tempting Heart"" is the story of a doomed romance between a pretty, vacant-headed schoolgirl and a sullen rock 'n' roll wannabe, and as the movie progresses -- and they grow up into comparatively healthy, happy adults -- it's apparent that the romance was doomed primarily because the screenplay said it was. Deus ex screenwriter.

There's another woman who's a third wheel in all senses of the term, who pops in simply to goose the action along.

The movie pops back and forth in time and place, from the sweethearts to an attractive older woman who's telling the story to a screenwriter. It doesn't take long to realize that it's her own story she's relating, but then late in the film we see the ""real"" people, and while they're presentable, they're not the dreamboats of the film romance. That's the fascinating idea -- that the concept and retelling of a romance is far more attractive to people than the real thing. It's like dissecting a film from the inside out.

Tech credits are adequate, ranging from a dreadful Santana guitar-solo ripoff to an absolutely fabulous effects shot, unfortunately, the very last shot in the movie. Stick around. ""Heart"" gets better as it goes on.",http://archives.starbulletin.com/1999/11/10/features/story3.html
64,18,風雲雄霸天下,Best Film,"The decline of Hong Kong's once distinct brand of shoe string budget filmmaking could be (and by some has been) tied to this hotly anticipated wuxia epic based on the popular comic book series Wind Cloud. An inadvertent but nonetheless caustic allegory for post-handover Hong Kong cinema Andrew Lau's ""The Storm Riders"" is a film divided by contradictions: The bubble gum cast is peppered with cameos from solid, established, reliable actors. The episodic nature of Manfred Wong's script despite a healthy two plus hour runtime is a thoroughly unelaborated upon odyssey that might have lived up to its potential as a 10 part TV mini series though once the film sets in this mess is hard to give up on. Comfort Chan's score which sounds as if it was lifted from a popular video game is a downright insult a la the underwhelming aesthetic quality of the overwrought CGI. Director Andrew Lau, who pulls double duty as the film's cinematographer, makes the most of China's natural beauty. ""The Storm Riders: The International Version"" is dubbed in English and exorcises nearly 40 minutes of footage rendering an already inchoate film officially unintelligible.",https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the-storm-riders/reviews?type=user
65,18,愈快樂愈墮落,Best Art Direction,"Not an easy story to follow, as it unfolds with a current/flashback story line throughout, and you aren't always aware of which medium you're in. Watching this film with someone was helpful(for me) in trying to piece together the story. Yet our combined version differs with the synopsis on the video box.

A movie different from any HK movies I've viewed before. Action begins in a gay sauna.....and I mean action. From there it mellows out, but the movie has a gay theme, so you're forewarned. The movie weaves between (1) pursuit of a widower(?) by a real estate salesman; (2) the husbands recollections of his wife; (3) the swimming trainers affair with the wife; and (4-5) which would give too much away.

Thought the acting and story line were quite good. The movie certainly keeps you attempting to put the puzzling pieces together. Mentioned my interpretation differed from the box synopsis...probably just put more intrigue into the movie, but if you see this movie, remember where the swimming trainer was from and the lack of clarification as to how or when an affair started.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0534280/?ref_=tt_urv

67,17,宋家皇朝,Best Film,"Modern Chinese History forms the backdrop for this sweeping portrait of the Soong Sisters, three siblings who married powerful men and used their positions to influence the politics of early 20th Century China. The film spans the period from the formation of the Chinese Republic in 1911 to the take-over by the Communists in 1949. The details of history take a back seat to the real focus of this movie, however, which delves into the intricate and intimate relationships these women have with their husbands, their parents, and each other.

Lushly photographed and superbly acted, the movie showcases the talents of three veteran actors of Asian Cinema. Michelle Yeoh, Maggie Cheung and Vivian Wu play sisters Ai-ling, Ching-ling, and May-ling Soong. All three seem well-cast and bring the full weight of their skill and experience to their roles. The move sizzles with electricity when these three beauties appear on screen together, as they do in several scenes. This is definitely a case where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Wen Jian gives an outstanding performance as father Charlie Soong, despite dying off half-way through the story. The death-bed scene, where he passes away in the presence of his wife and three daughters, is especially moving. Winston Chao and Hsing-Kuo Wu take sold turns as Sun Yat-Sen and Chiang Kai-Shek.

The story explores a number of themes in both a personal and social/historical context. Conflicts between father/daughter, old values/new values, old China/new China, and East/West all figure prominently in the plot. A shoe metaphor runs through-out the film, depicting the step-by-step movement of Chinese history, bringing to mind the old Chinese proverb, ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step."" This motif also reflects the increased role of women in Chinese social and political life, as they are liberated from the foot-binding that hobbled previous generations.

The movie is slow-moving at times, with some abrupt plot transitions. Director Mabel Cheung occasionally hits us over the head with that shoe to get her point across, and the script seems to contain some hints of political propaganda. Nevertheless, I found this to be a well-made and highly entertaining piece of Asian Cinema. Sadly, this movie is not likely to reach a wide North American audience because it's in Mandarin with English sub-titles. That's too bad, because it is just as accomplished as anything coming out of Hollywood these days, and well worth seeing.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0432446/?ref_=tt_urv
68,17,黑金,Best Art Direction,"Black Gold is a good portrayal of corruption in Taiwanese democratic politics, but is also packed with action, romance and all of the other trademark Hong Kong stuff. Yes, Hong Kong! I watched this movie not knowing what it was about, and was shocked to see two Hong Kong actors speaking terrible Mandarin in a movie set and filmed in Taiwan! Anyways, Black Gold is about a former mobster (Tony Leung Ka Fai) who tries to run for election in the Taiwanese Legislative Assembly and the cop who is out to stop him (Andy Lau Tak Wah)

One thing I disliked Black Gold is how Andy Lau's cop character is the protagonist, while Tony Leung's to-be politician is the antagonist; Tony faced way more obstacles (enemy mobsters, police investigation) than Andy did. Honestly, Andy really had no reason to hate Tony. On another note, I found there were many unnecessary characters, such as a Buddhist cult minister and a few extra mob bosses. Also, I also found that the action scenes were unclear and and the camera often seemed too close. There may also have been continuity problems, but this may be due to TV censorship.

Though not a great movie, it was nice to see rare shots of Taipei. And of course, viewers must remember that Hong Kong movies are cheesy, and it's important to overlook some minor errors.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0554331/?ref_=tt_urv

May 17, 2010
I really enjoyed it. The acting is perfect, the photography is great as well (very warm colours that reminded me of Wong Kar Wai films a little), and above all the use of music was delighful (a variety of cha-cha tracks that seem slightly out of place but at the same time, give the scenes a kind of detached irony, I don't know, it's just great). The story is nothing special, there's a nice twist at the end, otherwise it's not really the script but rather the style that makes the movie so good. The characters are delightfully quirky and have funny obessions and weird ways of having fun. It's a little violent, a couple of fights and fingers being cut but nothing too nasty to watch.",https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/odd_one_dies/reviews?type=user
70,16,甜蜜蜜,Best Film,"This movie is delightful from start to finish. Although some of the coincidences and chance meetings are highly improbable (both going to NYC? Both watching the same TV set at the same time?), they cannot spoil what is a genuinely touching and moving experience.

Instead of a the usual scenario where two people try desperately to find love, the two leads, Li Chiao (Maggie Cheung) and Li Xiao Jun (Leon Lai), try desperately to avoid it. Both Mainlanders, she has come to Hong Kong to make her fortune; he has come to earn enough money to marry his long-time fiancée back on the Mainland. Through a brief meeting in a McDonalds where Li Chiao works one of her several part-time jobs, and Xiao Jun has come to experience the unknown-in-his-hometown food, they become friends. They discover a shared love for the songs of Taiwanese singer Teresa Tang, which become the soundtrack to their relationship. Both are lonely, and gradually they form a genuine friendship, then a not-so-casual intimate relationship. Their struggle to remain true to their original goal in coming to Hong Kong leads to an emotional crisis for both them and their partners. The struggle takes place over a ten year period, during which they separate only to keep bumping into one another and reopening old wounds. The resolution of this struggle is sweet indeed.

The lead actors are both exceptional, particularly Leon Lai, who always seemed to be playing a variation on himself until this film. He is completely believable as the naive and trusting Xiao Jun, and Maggie Cheung is, as ever, radiant and affecting. The songs of Teresa Tang are used to great effect, one of which gives the film it's title (Tian mi mi, the title of the Chinese version, roughly translates as Sweet Like Honey).

Loses a point for the number of coincidences, but otherwise unreservedly recommended.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1004327/?ref_=tt_urv
71,16,甜蜜蜜,Best Art Direction,"Other reviewers have said it well: this is a wonderfully romantic film. I hate to make a statement like, ""It's the Asian version of . . . "", because the film doesn't need a comparison to any American film to have an identity, BUT it has several things in common with ""The Way We Were"", ""Comrades"" follows an up-and-down romance over the span of several years and has that same quality of bittersweet fate hanging over them throughout. The early scenes in which Li Xiaojun (Leon Lai) and Li Qiao (Maggie Cheung) begin their love affair are particularly entertaining. A favorite scene: Li Xiaojun helping Li Qiao on with her coat, they get closer and closer, their lips brush together, then they embrace, then a full on kiss, then mutual passion overtakes them as they both feverishly unbutton that same coat they had just been struggling to button. The scene is both sweetly romantic and humorous.

Another similarity to ""The Way We Were"" is that both films benefit from a tear-inducing song, in this case a love song by Taiwanese singer Teresa Tang which plays a vital role in the plot. Great job of direction by Peter Chan and a wonderful script, but it's the performance by Maggie Cheung that really sells the film. From the moment you see her behind the counter at McDonald's you're hooked by her energy, spunk, attitude, and determination. Her character runs the gamut of emotions during the course of the film and there wasn't one false moment in her performance. She is totally believable, whether she's flashing a self-satisfied grin into her ATM machine or dealing with a devastating loss (I won't give it away, but Cheung's reaction is heart-wrenching). ""Comrades"" is truly a wonderful film.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0942392/?ref_=tt_urv

The rough meeting, the soft touch, the first realization, the despair in the rain, the slight hope, the fate's sign and finally the supernatural power of emotions. All this with Hongkong and New York - two of the most exciting cities in the world - as background and casted with the outstanding actress Maggie Cheung who I'd love to see more often in the cinema.

But after many years, when I went to university, when the girl I deep in love with left me to another country. I saw DVD of this film again, alone. And this time I cannot help enjoying it. Every actor's line touched me very very much.

What's behind the mountain? May be another mountain, and another. How wonderful it'd be to forget the past. Everyday would be a new beginning. Isn't that great? What's love? Maybe love is to leave the one you love, to win the one then finally find you have lost everything including yourself.

Now I have my job and new life. Many things have been past for a long time. And this movie, I cannot remember some of the scenes. But sometimes I still recall lots of words they say.

The story, slow compared to Tsui Hark standards, flows through two paths: on the first one (lighthearted, playful and with a touch of irony which is never unwelcome) we get to enjoy the life of two snake-girls (White Snake, played by Joey Wang, and Green Snake, played by Maggie cheung) who, by stumbling into a village and alluring every one, cause a lot of turmoil among the people's hearts. White Snake, having trained much more than Green Snake and thus having acquired human feelings, actually succeeds in winning the love of the poetry teacher. On another scenario, the tibetan priest lives in a nearby temple, meditating, trying to gain spiritual ascension, helping people whenever they are in trouble and in general doing his best to preserve the natural balance of the world. However, not everything is like it seems at first glance: while the two snake-girls actually show some positive will and determination as they tend sick people, the priest, although he stops tidal waves from flooding the village, never goes down to experiencing the condition of people... and, by acting as judge, risks of falling into the trap of self-esteem and prejudice.

83,12,阮玲玉,Best Art Direction,"I'm a novice at Chinese history, especially in the area of periods of film, and, being American, I'm particularly fascinated by it and comparing it to period pieces set in the 1930's US (a la ""Cat's Meow"" or ""Miller's Crossing""). I was particularly taken with Centre Stage's attention to detail in period dress, music, and movie deal-making among the industry. As opposed to American movies focusing of stars/starlets' merciless climb to the top of the industry, Maggie Cheung plays Ruan as a kind, clever, and talented actress whose versatility and assertiveness helps her move beyond pigeonholing by the industry to play a wide range of parts--revolutionary, new woman, peasant-girl.

One part it seems which has been overlooked in the few reviews I've read is how this image of feminism illustrates China's version of liberation. Cheung plays Ruan as both a feminist in charge of her career, as well as a woman who is in control of her scandalous affair with Lawrence Ng's character. The difference between her and him being that men are understood to have concubines and are forgiven for the indecency, while Maggie's career is ruined (though she never apologizes for it in any way). Traditional roles still trump profession in 1930's China, but the sadness of it all being retold shows a strong Ruan overcoming every possible trap--losing a career over an affair, especially--and maintaining her desires for success.

For Cheung's performance, it never wavered. I was a big fan of hers in ""Irma Vep"" and she was just a strong in this role playing Ruan. Effortless shifts between emotion (""So, you're showing me your true face,"" her lover says as she blows smoke in his face obstinately, then switches to a kindly-wife smile--is she practicing her role in the movie, or is that really her?), graceful poise courtesy of the era before slouching was cool, private display of emotion, and elegant role-play as mistress and ex-wife with Tony Leung.

I'd have to know more about the history of Ruan to know if this is an accurate portrayal of her life, but the film-making style of inter-cutting Cheung playing her in the 30's while interviews with Ruan's colleagues from that time as they are interviewed by the director of the movie is a fascinating way to present her history.

Center Stage, aka Yuen Ling-Yuk (Cantonese pronunciation of the main character) or Ruan Ling-Yu (the mandarin equivalent) is a slow film, a period piece focused on the life and premature death of an actress in the 30's in China. As a kid growing up in Asia several decades ago I never watched B/W silent films, so Yuen was never known to me, until now.

It was a slow film, but well acted and researched. I enjoyed the depiction of Shanghai in the 30's and the personification of various people in the entertainment circle. This film is obviously not for everyone. For the selected few with the interest or the cultural background, it is a film worth watching.

88,10,阿飛正傳,Best Film,"In Wong Kar-wai's 1991 film Days of Being Wild, Yuddy (Leslie Cheung), a charming drifter captures the attention of store attendant Su Lizhen (Maggie Cheung) by asking her to look at his watch. When she sees that it says one minute before 3:00PM on April 16, 1960, he tells her that she will never forget the moment and will dream about him that night. The next time they meet, the moment becomes two, then one hour, then weeks and months but Yuddy is like the mythical bird with no legs that just flies and flies and never lands. Abandoned by his real mother and brought up by a wealthy alcoholic courtesan (Rebecca Pan), he does not know where he came from or where he is going. He treats women with little respect, discarding them when they no longer serve his purpose. When one lover asks him if he loves her, he tells her that during his life he will be friends with many, many women but won't know whom he truly loves until the end.

Days of Being Wild unfolds like a dream with color filters, unusual shadows, and the sights and sounds of Hong Kong's rainy nights and sweltering summers. Based on the director's memories from his childhood and admiration for the style of Argentinean novelist Manuel Puig (Heartbreak Tango), the film is a series of episodes involving six people who touch each other's lives. After his short-lived relationship with Su, Yuddy meets a cabaret dancer who calls herself Mimi (Carina Lau) but their relationship fares no better and she is left to suffer the consequences of their breakup. Meanwhile, Su meets Tide (Andy Lau), a gentle policeman whom she is able to confide until he suddenly leaves Hong Kong to become a sailor. Each character seeks a sense of identity and fulfillment. After Rebecca tells him of her plans to move to America with her boyfriend, she finally lets him know who and where his real mother is. After Yuddy goes to the Philippines to try to find his mother, the lives of the main protagonists come together in a powerful conclusion.

Days of Being Wild may sound like a soap opera but the film reaches a much higher artistic level. Supported by outstanding performances by Leslie Cheung, Maggie Cheung, and Jacky Cheung as Yuddy's only friend Zeb, it is a tone poem about longing and one's search for identity. We care about the characters even though they don't seem to care about themselves. Like many of us, they pine for the things that might have been, the word that was never said, and the love that remains elusive. A commercial failure but an artistic triumph, Days of Being Wild is a moody, atmospheric film that with its background of popular music, in this case 1950's rumbas and cha-cha's, forecasts the director's later In the Mood For Love. As a beautifully realized example of alienated people desperately seeking their place in the world, however, it stands securely on its own.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0290586/?ref_=tt_urv

93,9,奇蹟,Best Visual Effects,"I recently picked up a full, subtitled copy of 'Miracles', and I must say that the original is better than the dubbed version I had previously seen, and that version was also around half an hour shorter than the original version. The dubbed version cut out some not-so-important scenes, but things still got confusing at times, and some very funny scenes which did not make into the dubbed version, and at least one of the fight scenes was significantly edited in the dubbed version.

'Miracles' a very different movie to most of Jackie's work. There is the trademark Jackie Chan action and slapstick, but fights and action sequences are not as frequent as they are in his other movies, as 'Miracles' is more about Jackie proving to critics that he can make a movie with extravagant sets and costumes, and complicated camera shots (Who can blame him? James Cameron did the same thing, but 'Miracles' is a both an enjoyable and a good movie, while 'Titanic' is neither).

The movie is funny, and the action (what action there is) is excellent, and even the acting is great.

9/10 A great movie. Check it out if you're a Jackie Chan fan, but make sure you get the full, subtitled movie (should be about two-hours).",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0974197/?ref_=tt_urv

95,8,旺角卡門,Best Art Direction,"Wong Kar Wai's debut effort as a feature film director already showcase flashes of talent from the would-be auteur. ALthough not as groundbreaking or innovative as some of his better known films (eg. Chungking Express/ Fallen Angels), nevertheless it displayed some of his distinct signature styles, (eg. naturalistic & idiosyncratic dialogue, character driven films) and themes(eg. love,urban environment, world in turmoil and chaos)

Obviously inspired by Martin Scorsese's early effort 'Mean Streets', which was in turn partly inspired by 'beat' filmmaker John Cassevetes debut film 'Shadows'; 'As Tears Go by' is 'Mean streets' set in Hong Kong. The harsh depiction of traid and street gang culture is in sharp contrast to the stylish gun-totting hoods from John Woo's 'A Better Tomorrow'. In many ways, Wong's depiction came accross as more bittingly realistic, helped by its many on-location filming (another WKW style). Hong Kong's neon lit streets/dark dingy alleys/fluorescence interiors/late night piers, blended in perfectly with Wong's story set in contemporary urban HK. Very interesting camera work and lighting that is different from the other HK films coming out from that era. It displayed an early WKW visual flare, again evident in Chunking Express and Fallen Angels, which utilizes similar locations and settings, as well as ferentic camera movements and stylised composition. Credit should be due to art director Chang Shu Ping, who collaborated with Wong in all of his subsequent films. Of note too is cinematographer Andrew Lau, who will go on to helm the 'Young & Dangerous' series that bears several visual & subject matter influences from this film.Though I must add that Young & Dangerous portrayal of heroic gansters is more glorifying than Wong's pathetic bloodied characters.

Excellant performances from all three leads, which bagged Jacky CHeung(doing a Robert de niro) the best supporting actor and Andy Lau a nomination for best actor at that year's HK film awards. Maggie Chueng claimed that this was the first time she discovered the true potential of screen acting. Also unforgettable is Alex Man's supporting turn as the most sadistic villian imaginable.

'As Tears go By' is probably the only WKW film that is fully scripted (WOng served as a scriptwriter in other generic HK movies for several years before this effort), and it shows. Some clever and subtle original touches in the first act, that translates Scorsese's tortured characters and ethnic Itlian dispora to local HK flavor and motivations. However, the conflict dragged on by the second act, and the film seems indecisive as whether to focus on the Andy Lau/Maggie Cheung love story arc or on his dillema with his understudy pal Jacky Cheung and their conflict with bad ass Alex Man. Scorsese's 'Mean Streets' works because it manages to stay focus on the main protaganist POV and motivations. The whole film is centered around Harvey Keitel's character, and the other characters serves as his burden to his climb up the mafia ranks. That direction seems lost in Wong's version. The last act/conclusion seems rushed, cliche and definitely predictable. What I suspect, and logically seems plausible, is the interference of the producers and financiers on 'As Tears go by'. WOng had claimed in interviews that his early work was being hampered in many ways by others, hence his firm decision and insistence to be the producer in all his subsequent films. He wants to and achieves total artistic control over all of his later films.

Nevertheless, 'As Tears Go by' is without a doubt a milestone of WOng's career as well as Hong Kong cinema. The visceral on-screen violence, realistc seedy portrayal of HK's underworld and streets locale, and cosmopolitan loves and relationships was never before seen on HK screens during its day. It is preceded only by John Woo's 'A Better Tomorrow', which in many ways is a different kind of film with very different themes. Definitely worth catching for fans of Wong Kar Wai and those who love Hong Kong cinema.

7/10 from me.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0263967/?ref_=tt_urv
96,8,旺角卡門,Best Visual Effects,"I'm by no means a Kar Wai Wong aficionado; I've only seen 2 of his films (this and his follow-up feature ""Days of Being Wild""). But from what I've seen, this is the best place to start.

Kar Wai Wong films are very artistic, and from a technical perspective they are downright miraculous. However, as is the case with many artistic directors, an over emphasis on art can result in losing the audience. After all, not everyone is able to grasp the totality of a film in just 90 minutes. That said, if I had started with ""Days of Being Wild"" or even one of his more abstract creations I may have been lost.

""As Tears Go By"" is an excellent way to dip your toes in the pool. While it is rich with visual poetry, it is not so complex that it loses its audience. It has a linear story which uses explosive scenes of violence to keep us awake, and at the same time there is a gentle & poetic undercurrent. The story is about a young man who is involved in the criminal underworld, and his life is torn between 3 elements: duty to his bosses, loyalty to his friend, and a hope for love with a mysterious girl who drifts into his life.

It is an age-old theme, but it's always worth exploring because it cuts to the heart of who we are as humans. Within this story are powerful doses of rage, humility, fear and hope. What may separate this film from others is the way the main character wants to do the right thing. Sure, he's a tough guy, but he's not beyond rationality and knowing when to get the heck outta dodge. The question is, will life/fate allow him to do the right thing?

Although I feel that Kar Wai Wong's ""Days of Being Wild"" is a superior cinematic achievement, I think ""As Tears Go By"" has a more direct connection with the audience simply because the main character is very human and likable. Also his sidekick ""Fly"" is very funny. Good humor is rare in a lot of art films, but it's not lacking here.

I would compare ""As Tears Go By"" to another excellent film, Michael Mann's ""Heat"" with Robert De Niro playing the thief torn by the same 3 elements: duty, friends and love. Another good one is the Chinese film ""The Drummer"" about a gangster's son torn by which path to take: his father's (violent) or his sister's (caring). To me, the best in the genre is Takeshi Kitano's ""Hana-Bi"" (Fireworks) which really shows the bipolar life of a violent man who is deeply in love with his wife. If you liked any of these films, I think you'll enjoy ""As Tears Go By"". Similarly, if you like ATGB, check out the others I mentioned.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3087967/?ref_=tt_urv

This leads him to reevaluate his own behavior, but he's too timid to change his life even after he realizes he should. Writer-director Natalia Smirnoff emphasizes character and atmosphere over plot; apart from a few small interpersonal conflicts, this 2014 drama focuses exclusively on the hero's internal development. It feels like a short story more than a novel, but given the sympathetic and detailed characterization, that's not necessarily a bad thing.

98,7,倩女幽魂,Best Art Direction,"I first saw this film when it was transmitted around 1988 by the BBC when I was working on UK's 2000AD. My pal Steve Parkhouse recorded it on VHS and sent it to me. Up till this point, I'd really only seen the Shaw Bros kung fu movies, with their harsh lighting (so audience could see the moves clearly), so it was a revelation to me to see something that looked like it had been lit by Ridley Scott coming out of Hong Kong. This was also my first exposure to the movies of Tsui Hark (pronounced, apparently, ""Choy Huk"").

Yet for all the smoky, back-lit exteriors and ambitious special effects (Stop-motion? In a Hong Kong Movie?) at the heart of Chinese GHOST STORY lies a simple and moving love story, made all the more real by the outstanding acting talent of Leslie Cheung (what a tragic, tragic waste of a life!) and the beauty and elegance of Joey Wong. Granted Joey is gorgeous, but it's her balletic hand gestures that give her character an unattainable eroticism that's hard to analyse. And though Joey is now almost 20 years older (gawd, which of us isn't?) this will always be the enduring image of that actress.

Some reviewers here have said that the film is simplistic and lacks any surprises, but they're missing the fact that this movie was based on a famous Chinese story written by Pu Songling around 1700! That's a bit like complaining that Romeo and Juliet has a predictable ending and just copies WEST SIDE STORY.

For me, Chinese GHOST STORY is the quintessential romantic tale. It has high tragedy, because we know that Chio Sin and Sin Seen can never be together. It's about becoming mature, for none of us can mature until we've experienced great loss. It's about sacrifice, for sacrifice is an essential component of True Love. And the comedy stylings of Wu Ma don't hurt a bit, either.

Enjoy Chinese GHOST STORY by trying not to view it through a filter of Western culture and you'll get on with it just fine.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1437674/?ref_=tt_urv

100,6,火龍,Best Film,"Now when I the read the back of the DVD box, I saw huge potential in for this movie. The final results was disappointing, though it did provide the goods for the most part. Fire of Conscience centers on Captain Manfred who must solve a brutal murder to prove his partner's innocence and unearth the truth behind Hong Kong's police force. Now I was able to get into the movie story pretty quickly, unfortunately the longer it went the less I became invested. My main problem is that it focuses too much time on developing characters instead telling a story. I'm all for character development, but this was one time where it distracted from the main story. It also lacks good pacing as we have overly long dramatic scenes and not enough action scenes. The action scenes wouldn't be a problem if they weren't so unimpressive, expect for the climax which was unfortunately short. Now while I did generally the main story when it was concentrating on telling a story and many of the characters being developed, it didn't offer anything memorable. Dante Lam is not a director I'm familiar with and I could see why I never heard of him. For starter he does not know how to film an action scene as the camera is either in the wrong place or is too close to see what's happening. Another main complain is that his imagery is largely forgettable, but I'll admit when he's focus on telling a story he becomes very effective as a director. He does have an eye for giving the actors the proper screen time as he does with making a thrilling movie. Unfortunately the final results under his direction is mixed. Fire of Conscience is a action movie that fails to make a big impression on the audience. Fire of Conscience while not a bad action movie is certainly nothing impressive compared to other Asian action movies.",https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fire_of_conscience-2010

As he goes on, he discovers the desperate poverty of the population; it's not about the Boat People, but more about the desperation that forces the people to, in the words of the Chinese title, ""Flee towards the angry sea.""

Shot just after the war between China and Viet Nam, that goes a long way towards why the authorities permitted Anna Hui and her Hong Kong crew to shoot on Hainan. It's a telling story, not the least because the director lets you know this is a pure point-of-view story; every shot is perfectly composed, often beautiful in its horror. Even after Lam abandons his camera, the beautiful images continue; he's trapped with his photographer's eye, seeing things as they really are, yet unable to see anything but the beauty of misery.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6241306/?ref_=rw_urv
103,2,投奔怒海,Best Art Direction,"A Japanese photographer returns to Vietnam three years after documenting its 'liberation' and becomes increasingly involved in the fate of a young girl and her family. It is a time of poverty, violence and death.

There are many deaths in this film and the majority of these deaths are graphically depicted. One of the least explicit, but perhaps the most moving, occurs on a scrap heap surrounded by a body of filthy water. While the young victim's blood is still flowing out, his peer runs the length of the heap bearing a standard, his identity and the colours of the flag rendered anonymous by the remote camera angle and the silhouette produced by the setting sun. The boy lays the flag over the body with a timeliness and purpose that implies he is always ready for such tragedies. It is one of the film's most striking images, calling to mind such questionable iconic images as the flag-raisers of Iwo Jima.

Such readings are possible over much of the film. Director Ann Hui's 'vérité' camera calls to mind Altman's M*A*S*H, as does her treatment of violence and its bloody consequences - something which contrasts with the comic book violence of later 80s Hong Kong films (with which many people are more familiar). Comparisons could also be made with Kubrick's use of zoom (though M*A*S*H has this too) and formal composition, with characters placed in the centre of frame as if being interviewed for live television. Kubrick, of course, would later direct his own Vietnam masterpiece, Full Metal Jacket.

Comparisons could even be made with Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now. Coppola's helicopter sequence filmed in the Philippines shares a lot with Hui's remarkable opening shot of tanks driving through the streets of Hainan, China (both standing in for Vietnam). However, where Coppola tended towards using the imagery of Vietnam to attain a greater artistic goal, Hui would be discredited for receiving any such reading. Where the sound of Coppola's napalm explosions bring a certain excitement and satisfaction to the viewer, the gunshots heralding executions and the chance for children to pillage the corpses has an entirely different motive and effect.

One of the film's strengths is that, while it plays with, even exploits some well-established grammars of film making - tragedy, documentary, romance - it never defers to a single one. The film works on each level equally well. It is a well-told story: excellently paced and genuinely compelling right up to the end credits. At the other end of the spectrum, it is perhaps the boldest and most unflinching criticism of the brutality and hypocrisy of communist states to come out of a small island that would, 17 years later, become a Special Administrative Region of such a state.

The film has elements of curiosity. One can accept for purely practical reasons the need for Cantonese to be the common language of Vietnamese and Japanese characters. It is harder to understand why a Japanese man (played by a local Hong Kong actor) should be the main protagonist, especially considering the film's political overtones. Does he represent objectiveness or irony? Perhaps there is no single answer.

Despite some minor flaws, the film manages to illustrate without preaching, condescending or even aestheticising the subject, even though the dimly-lit tableaux and pitch-perfect editing combine very pleasingly for the eye. Hui works with a lightness of touch rarely seen in Hong Kong or Hollywood at that time or since and with a feminist subtext scarcely seen in her later work. This film well-deserves the acclaim with which it was awarded on its release and is sadly underrated at the time of writing. It serves as an interesting and important counterpoint to the various lavish 'magnum opuses' of American directors of that era and has an enduring relevance and importance that many young people, especially of the film's native land, would benefit from experiencing.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1987205/?ref_=tt_urv
